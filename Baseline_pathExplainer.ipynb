      "PMID Texts: [\"Experimental study on the effect of chrysin on skin injury induced by amiodarone extravasation in rats. Amiodarone is the first choice for the treatment of arrhythmia, but it is easy to cause extravasation during infusion, after extravasation, it often cause skin injury. The healing of skin injury induced by amiodarone is an inflammatory process. Chrysin, a natural flavonoid, has been investigated to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It was reported that chrysin can promote wound healing. So this study aims to investigate the effect of chrysin on amiodarone extravasation-induced skin injury model in rats. The rat model of skin extravasation injury was established by subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL of amiodarone. After successful modeling, the rats were randomly assigned to the five groups: control group, 10% DMSO group, and low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose chrysin groups (10, 20 and 40 mg/mL). The extravasation injury model was given locally on the same day for seven days. On day 0, 3, 7 and 10 of administration, the lesion's image were taken to calculate the area, and the tissue of the lesion were collected for H&E staining. Then, the level of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured by ELISA, and the protein expression level of bFGF in the wound tissue were detected by immunohistochemical staining. It was found that chrysin groups (20 and 40 mg/mL) compared to contronl group and 10% DMSO solvent group significantly decreased area injury, IL-6 and TNF-alpha(P < 0.05) on day 3, 7, 10. On the other hand, the chrysin group (40 mg/mL) compared to contronl group and 10% DMSO group significantly increase bFGF(P < 0.05) on day 3, 7. Chrysin were effective in reducing injury area, reducing inflammation, and promoting the secretion of bFGF, it can promote the healing of skin injury induced by amiodarone extravasation in rats. These findings provide a good theoretical and experimental basis for the prevention and treatment of amiodarone extravasation-induced skin injury, and provide evidence for finding potential healing agents for the prevention and treatment of amiodarone and other corrosive extravasation-induced injuries from the molecular and cytological levels, thus solving the clinical problems. \"]\n",

      "PMID Texts: ['Efflux transport of chrysin and apigenin sulfates in HEK293 cells overexpressing SULT1A3: The role of multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4/ABCC4). Efflux transport is a critical determinant to the pharmacokinetics of sulfate conjugates. Here we aimed to establish SULT1A3 stably transfected HEK293 cells, and to determine the contributions of BCRP and MRP transporters to excretion of chrysin and apigenin sulfates. The cDNA of SULT1A3 was stably introduced into HEK293 cells using a lentiviral vector, generating a sulfonation active cell line (i.e., SULT293 cells). Identification of sulfate transporters was achieved through chemical inhibition (using chemical inhibitors) and biological inhibition (using short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)) methods. Sulfated metabolites were rapidly generated and excreted upon incubation of SULT293 cells with chrysin and apigenin. Ko143 (a selective BCRP inhibitor) did not show inhibitory effects on sulfate disposition, whereas the pan-MRP inhibitor MK-571 caused significant reductions (38.5-64.3%, p<0.001) in sulfate excretion and marked elevations (160-243%, p<0.05) in sulfate accumulation. Further, two efflux transporters (BCRP and MRP4) expressed in the cells were knocked-down by shRNA-mediated silencing. Neither sulfate excretion nor sulfate accumulation was altered in BCRP knocked-down cells as compared to scramble cells. By contrast, MRP4 knock-down led to moderate decreases (17.1-20.6%, p<0.05) in sulfate excretion and increases (125-135%, p<0.05) in sulfate accumulation. In conclusion, MRP4 was identified as an exporter for chrysin and apigenin sulfates. The SULT1A3 modified HEK293 cells were an appropriate tool to study SULT1A3-mediated sulfonation and to characterize BCRP/MRP4-mediated sulfate transport. ']\n",

      "PMID Texts: ['Interactions of mefloquine with ABC proteins, MRP1 (ABCC1) and MRP4 (ABCC4) that are present in human red cell membranes. Human erythrocyte membranes express the multidrug resistance-associated proteins, MRP1, MRP4 and 5, that collectively can efflux oxidised glutathione, glutathione conjugates and cyclic nucleotides. It is already known that the quinoline derivative, MK-571, is a potent inhibitor of MRP-mediated transport. We here examine whether the quinoline-based antimalarial drugs, amodiaquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, primaquine, quinidine and quinine, also interact with erythrocyte MRPs with consequences for their access to the intracellular parasites or for efflux of oxidised glutathione from infected cells. Using inside-out vesicles prepared from human erythrocytes we have shown that mefloquine and MK-571 inhibit transport of 3 microM [(3)H]DNP-SG known to be mediated by MRP1 (IC(50) 127 and 1.1 microM, respectively) and of 3.3 microM [(3)H]cGMP thought but not proven to be mediated primarily by MRP4 (IC(50) 21 and 0.41 microM). They also inhibited transport in membrane vesicles prepared from tumour cells expressing MRP1 or MRP4 and blocked calcein efflux from MRP1-overexpressing cells and BCECF efflux from MRP4-overexpressing cells. Both stimulated ATPase activity in membranes prepared from MRP1 and MRP4-overexpressing cells and inhibited activity stimulated by quercetin or PGE(1), respectively. Neither inhibited [alpha-(32)P]8-azidoATP binding confirming that the interactions are not at the ATP binding site. These results demonstrate that mefloquine and MK-571 both inhibit transport of other substrates and stimulate ATPase activity and thus may themselves be substrates for transport. But at concentrations achieved clinically mefloquine is unlikely to affect the MRP1-mediated transport of GSSG across the erythrocyte membrane. ']\n",

The accumulation mechanisms of amiodarone (AMD) involving transporters in lung alveolar epithelial type II cells were studied. The uptake of AMD was examined using human alveolar epithelial-derived cell line A549 as a model. AMD was transported by the carrier-mediated system, and the apparent K(m) and V(max) values were 66.8+/-30.3 muM and 49.7+/-9.7 nmol/mg protein/5 min, respectively.

The inhibition profiles were similar to the inhibitory effects of several compounds on OATP2B1-mediated E-3-S transport, and RT-PCR analysis showed mRNA expression of OATP2B1 and 1B3 in A549 cells. SiRNAs targeted to the OATP2B1 gene decreased the OATP2B1 mRNA expression level in A549 cells up to about 50% and reduced the uptake of AMD up to about 40%.

Antagonizing the action of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) may have important clinical implications for preventing inducer-drug interactions and improving therapeutic efficacy. We identified a widely distributed isothiocyanate, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), which acts as an effective antagonist of the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3). HepG2 cells were used to assay reporter function, mRNA levels, and protein expression. Catalytic activities of the PXR and CAR target genes, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, respectively, were also assessed in differentiated HepaRG cells. Protective effects of AITC on rifampin-induced cytotoxicity were observed, and transient transfection assays showed that AITC was able to effectively attenuate the agonist effects of rifampin and CITCO on human PXR and CAR activity, respectively. AITC-mediated reduction in the transcriptional activity of PXR and CAR correlated well with the suppression of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 expression in HepG2 cells, which reflected the reduced catalytic activities of both of these genes following AITC treatment in differentiated HepaRG cells. Furthermore, AITC disrupts the co-regulations of PXR with several important co-regulators. Furthermore, the antagonist effect of AITC against PXR was found in HepaRG cells upon addition of acetaminophen (APAP) and amiodarone, indicating that AITC protects cells from drug-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results show that AITC inhibits the transactivation effects of PXR and CAR and reduces the expression and function of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Additionally, AITC reversed the cytotoxic effects of APAP and amiodarone induced by PXR ligand. Results from this study suggest that AITC could be a powerful agent for reducing potentially dangerous interactions between transcriptional inducers of CYP enzymes and therapeutic drugs. ']\n",

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can cause serious social and economic burdens. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is one of the most common natural isothiocyanates and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant biological activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether AITC regulated Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), reactive oxide species (ROS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels via Nrf2 and Notch1 signaling pathways to treat COPD and whether there was an interaction between these two pathways. Lung function indexes and histopathological changes in mice were determined by lung function instrument and HE staining, respectively. The protein expression was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The mRNA expression was measured by RT-PCR in human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE. The contents of ROS, GSH and GSSG were detected by kits in 16HBE cells. The protein expression of Notch1, Hes1, MRP1, Nrf2, and HO-1 in lung tissues of WT mice and untransfected cells were significantly down-regulated in COPD, then significantly ameliorated in treatment groups. The protein expression of MRP1, Notch1 and Hes1 in lung tissues of Nrf2-/- mice were markedly reduced. There was a significant reduction in expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and MRP1 in si-Notch1 transfected cells. Pretreatment with AITC markedly improved oxidative stress and GSH-redox disorder in COPD.

', 'Allyl isothiocyanate increases MRP1 expression in cigarette smoke extract-stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells via the JNK/Nrf2 pathway. Multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) is involved in the biological transport of several molecules with diverse structural characteristics outside of the cell. In addition to its transport activity, MRP1 exhibits multiple defense mechanisms in vivo. MRP1 is highly expressed in normal lung tissues and plays a protective role in the process of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the present study, human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-cells) were stimulated by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in vitro to simulate a smoking environment. On this basis, the mechanism of Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) administration on the expression of MRP1 in CSE-stimulated 16HBE14o-cells was investigated. The effects of CSE on the viability of 16 HBE14o-cells were investigated by an MTT assay. The changes in the mRNA expression levels of nuclear erythroid factor 2 (Nrf2) and MRP1 were investigated in CSE-stimulated 16HBE14o-cells using western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Immunofluorescence analysis was used to detect Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Incubation of the cells with 5% CSE for 24 h had minor effects on cell viability and resulted in the activation of the JNK and p38MAPK signaling pathways. AITC activated the JNK pathway, inhibited the activation of the p38MAPK pathway in 16HBE14o-cells stimulated by 5% CSE and upregulated the expression levels of Nrf2 and MRP1 in a time-dependent manner. The upregulation of Nrf2, MRP1 and of Nrf2, and MRP1 mRNA expression levels in CSE-stimulated cells was inhibited by pretreatment with SP600125 (a JNK pathway inhibitor). Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity in the nucleus was significantly enhanced following AITC pretreatment and the analysis indicated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the cells. These results indicated that Nrf2 and MRP1 expression levels in CSE-stimulated cells were altered following AITC pretreatment. Thus demonstrating that the primary mechanism may be associated with activation of the JNK pathway, while the p38MAPK pathway may not be involved. ', 'Allyl isothiocyanate upregulates MRP1 expression through Notch1 signaling in human bronchial epithelial cells. Multidrug resistance associated protein-1 (MRP1) and Notch signaling are closely related and both play a critical role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) establishment and progression. The aim of our work was to test whether Notch1 is involved in allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induced MRP1 expression. We used cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to simulate the smoking microenvironment in vitro. The results demonstrated that CSE led to apoptosis as well as reduced the expression of Notch1, Hes1, and MRP1, while AITC significantly reversed this downregulation. Transfected with Notch1 siRNA downregulated MRP1 expression and activity, aggravated the suppression effect by CSE, and abolished the AITC-induced Notch1, Hes1, and MRP1 expression. Validation of the correlation between Notch1 and MRP1 was implemented by gel-shift assays (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). The result revealed an interaction between a specific promoter region of MRP1 and the intracellular domain of Notch1. In conclusion, Notch1 signaling positively regulated MRP1 in 16HBE cells and AITC induced MRP1 expression and function may be attributed to Notch1 signaling. These findings show that Notch1 and MRP1 might have a potential protective effect in the COPD process and become a new therapeutic target for COPD or other lung diseases. It also provides a theoretical basis for the therapeutic effects of AITC. ', 'Allyl isothiocyanate may reverse the expression of MRP1 in COPD rats via the Notch1 signaling pathway. In the present study, the roles of AITC in up-regulating the MRP1 expression and its relationship with the activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway were investigated by combining the in vivo and in vitro experiments. AITC was administered to the COPD model rats and normal rats to explore the association between Notch1 and MRP1. The human bronchial epithelial cells were treated with DAPT, the Notch1 signaling pathway inhibitor, to verify the effect of Notch1 on the expression of AITC-induced MRP1. Compared with the control group, the expressions of Notch1, Hes1 (the target gene of Notch1) and MRP1 in the lung tissue of the COPD model group were significantly inhibited. In contrast to the COPD model group, the expressions of MRP1, Hes1 and Notch1 dramatically up-regulated following the treatment with Low/High doses of AITC. The expression of MRP1 in the 16 HBE cells was down-regulated by the inhibition of Notch in a DAPT concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, the AITC-induced up-regulation of the MRP1 expression was markedly impaired following the inhibition of Notch1. The above results indicated that the pulmonary function and the expression of MRP1 in COPD rats could be improved by AITC, which was partly dependent on the Notch1 signaling pathway. Therefore, targeting the Notch signaling pathway may present as an effective therapeutic strategy for COPD treatment.

Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, plays an important role in normal lung physiology by protecting cells against oxidative stress and toxic xenobiotics. The present study investigates the effects of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) on MRP1 mRNA and MRP1 protein expression and transporter activity in the immortalised human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o-. MRP1 mRNA and MRP1 protein expression in 16HBE14o- cells that were treated with allyl isothiocyanate were analysed by real-time PCR assay and Western blotting. The transport of carboxyfluorescein, a known MRP1 substrate, was measured by functional flow cytometry to evaluate MRP1 activity. Treatment with AITC at concentrations of 5-40 muM increased MRP1 protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner. AITC treatments at concentrations of 1-40 muM caused concentration-dependent increases in MRP1 mRNA levels that were up to seven times greater than the levels found in control cells. Finally, AITC treatment at concentrations of 5-40 muM significantly increased MRP1-dependent efflux in 16HBE14o- cells. These results suggest that AITC can increase the expression and activity of MRP1 in 16HBE14o- cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The upregulation of MRP1 activity and expression by AITC could produce therapeutic effects in the treatment of lung disease. ']\n",

', 'The clinical spectrum of amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy. To describe the clinical spectrum of amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy. Observational cases series and review. Of 55 cases, the median interval for onset of optic neuropathy was four months after initiating amiodarone; 88% occurred within 12 months. Seven (13%) patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-two (40%) patients presented with sudden visual loss, while 26 (47%) had insidious loss of vision. Visual acuity ranged from 20/15 to light perception; 10 (18%) patients had legal blindness with visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Visual field loss was present in 91% of cases. Color vision loss was present in eight (40%) of 20 cases. Optic disc edema was present in 85% of cases, while eight (15%) patients had retrobulbar optic neuropathy, without evidence of disc edema. Optic disc edema resolved over a median time of three months. Five patients had raised intracranial pressure on lumbar puncture. We were able to classify amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy into five clinical categories with respect to temporal characteristics and optic nerve appearance: insidious-onset (43%), acute-onset (28%), retrobulbar (13%), increased intracranial pressure (8%), and delayed-progressive onset (8%). Most cases of optic neuropathy commenced within 12 months of initiating amiodarone, with the median onset being four months. Over 10% of patients will have no visual symptoms at the onset. Ophthalmologic examinations within the first 12 months--and particularly within four months of initiating amiodarone--should improve early detection of amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy.

Amiodarone is a commonly prescribed and one of the most effective anti-arrhythmic drugs available. However, its use is limited by serious toxic adverse effects including optic neuropathy. Previously, amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy has been reported at an incidence of 1.3%-1.8%. Nearly, one-third of patients with amiodarone-induced toxic optic neuropathy are asymptomatic and typically visual acuity improves after drug cessation. We describe the case of a 75-year-old woman who experienced severe optic neuropathy with bilateral optic disc edema and hemorrhages, irreversible loss of vision, and severe defects in visual fields after 1.5 months use of amiodarone. The optic disc edema resolved promptly after discontinuation of the drug, but the patient remained blind permanently. This is the first report of only 6.5 weeks of amiodarone treatment resulting in bilateral optic neuropathy with bilateral and irreversible loss of vision. To ideally establish a connection between amiodarone and optic neuropathy, re-exposure of the patient to the drug should reproduce the symptoms. As a limitation of the study, this was not done in the present case because it would have been unethical. The worldwide growth of the elderly population in number is expected to increase age-related conditions including cardiac diseases. The use of cardiovascular drugs, also anti-arrhythmic agents such as amiodarone, may increase. Thus, clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of drug-induced toxic optic neuropathy, especially if a patient receiving a regimen of amiodarone complains of visual problems. ', 'Amiodarone and optic neuropathy: the heart of the matter. Amiodarone is one of the most effective antiarrhythmic drugs currently available. Although a subject of intense controversy, a causal link between amiodarone and optic neuropathy has never been firmly established. Indications for treatment with amiodarone are outlined, and features of the optic neuropathy in patients on amiodarone are compared with those of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. An approach to patients treated with amiodarone who present with optic neuropathy is outlined, and suggestions for a registry and prospective study of such patients are presented.

Amiodarone and dronedarone have recognized ophthalmological adverse effects including optic neuropathy. The recognition of optic neuropathy as a complication of amiodarone and dronedarone treatment may enable withdrawing the drug and accordingly preventing permanent vision loss. This study aimed to describe a case of optic neuropathy after substitution of amiodarone with dronedarone for treatment of atrial fibrillation. An 81-year-old man treated with dronedarone for atrial fibrillation after amiodarone had caused tremor developed sequential permanent vision loss in both eyes.

', \"Amiodarone and optic neuropathy. To investigate the clinical, perimetric, contrast sensitivity and visual evoked potentials findings in patients on longterm treatment with amiodarone. We enrolled 14 patients (age range 47-78 years, mean age 62.7 years) on chronic amiodarone therapy (mean cumulative dose of 519 g), and 14 age-matched control subjects. Participants were submitted to ophthalmological examination, kinetic visual field testing (Goldmann), standard achromatic automated perimetry (central 30-2, Humphrey), computerized isoluminant chromatic contrast sensitivity (CCS) and pattern visual evoked potentials evaluation (VEP). Data from baseline, 6-month and 1-year follow-up examinations were analysed. The main outcome measures were: initial and final corrected visual acuity; corneal, optic disc and fundus abnormalities; mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) central 30-2 perimetry parameters; visual field loss on kinetic perimetry; indices of CCS (tritan, protan and deutan axes), and pattern VEP latency (L-VEP) and VEP amplitude (a-VEP). We found a statistically significant difference between the patients and controls' baseline L-VEP and a-VEP measurements (p < 0.001). We found no significant correlation between prolonged L-VEP and duration of amiodarone use (r = 0.07). After a 1-year follow-up, we evidenced an average increment in L-VEP of 1.96 ms and a-VEP measurements showed a decline of 0.69 micro V. In cumulative dose-specific analyses, mean differences between baseline and 12-month L-VEP measurements were more evident in those taking higher than 200 g cumulative amiodarone doses (p = 0.03). We found abnormal tritan CCS results in 19 eyes (68%). Of these, four eyes belonged to patients with no ocular disease (diabetes, cataracts). No significant differences were observed between the baseline and 12-month clinical eye examinations, central 30-2 perimetry and CCS results. We found a significant prolongation in pattern L-VEP and a significant reduction in pattern a-VEP in patients on longterm treatment with amiodarone compared to control subjects. Nevertheless, current data are insufficient to recommend appropriate methods of visual screening. \", '', 'Two cases of bilateral amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy. The widespread use of amiodarone is limited by its toxicity, notably to the optic nerve. We report two cases of bilateral optic nerve neuropathy due to amiodarone, and provide a detailed description of the disease. The first case was a 59-year-old man complaining from insidious monocular loss of vision within ten months of initiating amiodarone. Funduscopy and optical coherence tomography showed bilateral optic disc edema. The second case was a 72-year-old man presenting with a decrease in visual acuity in his left eye for a month. Funduscopy showed a left optic nerve edema, and fluorescein angiography showed bilateral papillitis. In both cases, the clinical presentation was not suggestive of ischemic neuropathy, because of the preservation of visual acuity and the insidious onset. In addition, both cardiovascular and inflammatory work-up were normal. An amiodarone-associated neuropathy was suspected, and amiodarone was discontinued with the approval of the cardiologist, with complete regression of the papilledema and a stabilization of visual symptoms. Differentiating between amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy may be complicated by the cardiovascular background of such patients. The major criterion is the absence of a severe decrease in visual acuity; other criteria are the normality of cardiovascular and inflammatory work-up, and the improvement or the absence of worsening of symptoms after discontinuation of amiodarone. Amiodarone-associated neuropathy remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and requires amiodarone discontinuation, which can only be done with the approval of a cardiologist, and sometimes requires replacement therapy.

To report clinical features of amiodarone-induced optic neuropathy and outline the differentiation of amiodarone optic neuropathy from nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. We reviewed data from 73 patients reported to have developed an optic neuropathy while taking amiodarone. Amiodarone optic neuropathy is characterized by an insidious onset, slow progression, bilateral visual loss, and protracted disk swelling that tends to stabilize within several months of discontinuing the medication. Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy is characterized by acute, unilateral visual loss that is usually complete at onset, with resolution of disk edema over several weeks. Unique clinical features of amiodarone-induced optic neuropathy may help clinicians diagnose and distinguish between amiodarone-induced optic neuropathy and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

At diagnosis RNFL average was of 188 mum OD and 77 mum in the left eye (OS), six months after discontinuation of the drug decreased to 40 mum in OD and 76 mum in OS. The RNFL average of OD presented a transient increase during the acute oedema that returned to normal levels during the first month after discontinuation of the drug and fell dramatically to 44 mum at the second month and 40 mum at the sixth month.

The antiarrhythmic agent, amiodarone (Cordone), Pacerone), has been reported to cause optic neuropathy.

A total of 296 reports were identified: 214 from the Adverse Event Reporting System, 59 from published case reports, and 23 from adverse events reports for patients enrolled in clinical trials. Mean duration of amiodarone therapy before vision loss was 9 months (range 1-84 months). Insidious onset of amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy (44%) was the most common presentation, and nearly one third were asymptomatic. Optic disk edema was present in 85% of cases. Following drug cessation, 58% had improved visual acuity, 21% were unchanged, and 21% had further decreased visual acuity. Legal blindness (<20/200) was noted in at least one eye in 20% of cases.

The clinical manifestations of GCA can mimic that of other ocular disorders including amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy (AAON). We report a case of biopsy-proven GCA in a patient initially suspected to have AAON. This patient presented with bilateral optic disc oedema in conjunction with subacute predominately monocular vision loss and enhancement of the corresponding optic nerve sheath on neuroimaging.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify alternative agents that act synergistically with BCR-ABL TKIs in BP-CML. Our results show that the anti-malarial agent, mefloquine augments the efficacy of TKIs in CML cell lines and primary CML cells in vitro, including those with the T315I mutation. This effect is selective as mefloquine is more effective in inducing apoptosis, inhibiting colony formation and self-renewal capacity of CD34+ cells derived from TKI-resistant BP-CML patients than normal cord blood (CB) CD34+ stem/progenitor cells. Notably, the combination of mefloquine and TKIs at sublethal concentrations leads to synergistic effects in CML CD34+ cells, while sparing normal CB CD34+ cells. We further demonstrate that the initial action of mefloquine in CML cells is to increase lysosomal biogenesis and activation, followed by oxidative stress, lysosomal lipid damage and functional impairment. Taken together, our work elucidates that mefloquine selectively augments the effects of TKIs in CML stem/progenitor cells by inducing lysosomal dysfunction. ']\n",

Drug-drug interactions pose a difficult drug safety problem, given the increasing number of individuals taking multiple medications and the relative complexity of assessing the potential for interactions. For example, sofosbuvir-based drug treatments have significantly advanced care for hepatitis C virus-infected patients, yet recent reports suggest interactions with amiodarone may cause severe symptomatic bradycardia and thus limit an otherwise extremely effective treatment. Here, we evaluated the ability of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to recapitulate the interaction between sofosbuvir and amiodarone in vitro, and more generally assessed the feasibility of hiPSC-CMs as a model system for drug-drug interactions. Sofosbuvir alone had negligible effects on cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, whereas the sofosbuvir-amiodarone combination produced dose-dependent effects beyond that of amiodarone alone. By comparison, GS-331007, the primary circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir, had no effect alone or in combination with amiodarone. Further mechanistic studies revealed that the sofosbuvir-amiodarone combination disrupted intracellular calcium (Ca2+) handling and cellular electrophysiology at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, and mechanical activity at supra-pharmacological (30x Cmax) concentrations.

However, in a few in vitro studies, the combination of sofosbuvir and amiodarone resulted in tachycardiac effects in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). This discrepancy may be attributable to the use of immature hiPSC-CMs in the in vitro studies. To address this, we evaluated the ability of our in-house hiPSC-CMs to assess the interactions between sofosbuvir and amiodarone in vitro. We performed whole-cell patch recordings on hiPSC-CMs to examine the cardiac effect of sofosbuvir and amiodarone, alone or in combination.

Furthermore, the bradycardiac effect was membrane potential dependent: it increased with depolarization. This raised the possibility that the bradycardiac effects in vivo may originate in nodal cells, which have a more depolarized resting membrane potential compared with ventricular cells.

Patients treated with amiodarone and/or propranolol should be continuously monitored within the early hours following the initiation of sofosbuvir. ', 'Severe Bradycardia Induced by Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone which Resolved after the Discontinuation of Both Drugs. Amiodarone, prescribed for cardiac conditions, including dysrhythmia, is associated with bradycardia. However, few reports have demonstrated that bradycardia is observed when amiodarone is used in combination with sofosbuvir, a direct-acting antiviral drug for chronic hepatitis C. We herein report the case of a male patient in his 70s with chronic atrial fibrillation and prostatic hyperplasia and was also taking amiodarone, who experienced severe bradycardia and syncope a day after taking sofosbuvir and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C. After discontinuing amiodarone, ribavirin, and sofosbuvir, bradycardia did not recur. Therefore, we must consider drug interactions between amiodarone and sofosbuvir in patients with severe bradycardia. ', 'In brief: severe bradycardia with sofosbuvir and amiodarone. ']\n",

The metacestode stage causes cystic echinococcosis (CE) mainly in the human liver and lung. Current chemotherapy against CE is based on mebendazole and albendazole. However, benzimidazoles result in a low cure rate or are ineffective in many patients; therefore, novel compounds for the treatment of this disease have been studied. Mefloquine was reported to be dramatically effective on cultured Echinococcus multilocularis metacestodes in vitro. And, nitazoxanide has a prominent protoscolicidal effect. However, these compounds have no impact on the growth of cysts harbored in mice. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of mebendazole, mefloquine, and nitazoxanide against E. granulosus protoscoleces, germinal cells, and infected mice. The effect of mebendazole on protoscoleces and germinal cell was proved to be dose-dependent in vitro. And, a reduction of the cyst weight was also the found after oral application of mebendazole to infected mice. Mefloquine (5 and 10 mug/ml) caused death within 24 h of protoscoleces and germinal cells in vitro, whereas a lower concentration of 1 mug/ml was ineffective. In mice infected with E. granulosus, oral mefloquine (200 and 400 mg/kg twice weekly for 2 weeks) showed no reduction in parasite weight. Without affecting the viability of germinal cells and the growth of hydatid cysts, nitazoxanide only showed protoscolicidal effects in infected mice. In conclusion, mebendazole, mefloquine, and nitazoxanide showed various effects on E. granulosus under different conditions. These drugs could be useful to some extent in the treatment of CE. ']\n",

Amiodarone is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of irregular heartbeats. Although effective in clinical practice, the long-term use of amiodarone has many unwanted side effects, including cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, and neurological toxicities. Our objective was to elucidate effects of amiodarone exposure on the cholesterol metabolism in cultured neuronal and non-neuronal cells and in individuals taking amiodarone. We observed that amiodarone increases distinct cholesterol precursors in different cell types in a dose-dependent manner. In liver and kidney cell lines, amiodarone causes increase in desmosterol levels, and in primary cortical neurons and astrocytes, amiodarone increases zymosterol, zymostenol, and 8-dehydrocholesterol (8-DHC). We conclude that amiodarone inhibits two enzymes in the pathway, emopamil binding protein (EBP) and dehydrocholesterol reductase 24 (DHCR24). Cortical neurons and astrocytes are more sensitive to amiodarone than liver and kidney cell lines. We confirmed the inhibition of EBP enzyme by analyzing the sterol intermediates in EBP-deficient Neuro2a cells versus amiodarone-treated control Neuro2a cells. To determine if the cell culture experiments have clinical relevance, we analyzed serum samples from amiodarone users. We found that in patient serum samples containing detectable amount of amiodarone there are elevated levels of the sterol precursors zymosterol, 8-DHC, and desmosterol. This study illustrates the need for close monitoring of blood biochemistry during prolonged amiodarone use to minimize the risk of side effects. ']\n",

We report two women who presented histopathologically with leukocytoclastic vasculitis as the first cutaneous manifestation and were subsequently diagnosed with APS associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patient 1 presented with widespread cutaneous necrosis (WCN) with rapidly spreading pain down the lower extremities.

Amiodarone, lamotrigine, and phenytoin, common antiarrhythmic and antiepileptic drugs, inhibit a persistent sodium current in neurons (I(NaP)). Previous results from our laboratory suggested that I(NaP) is critical for functionality of peripheral chemoreceptors. In this study, we determined the effects of therapeutic levels of amiodarone, lamotrigine, and phenytoin on peripheral chemoreceptor and ventilatory responses to hypoxia. Action potentials (APs) of single chemoreceptor afferents were recorded using suction electrodes advanced into the petrosal ganglion of an in vitro rat peripheral chemoreceptor complex. AP frequency (at Po(2) approximately 150 Torr and Po(2) approximately 90 Torr), conduction time, duration, and amplitude were measured before and during perfusion with therapeutic dosages of the drug or vehicle. Hypoxia-induced catecholamine secretion within the carotid body was measured using amperometry. With the use of whole body plethysmography, respiration was measured in unanesthesized rats while breathing room air, 12% O(2), and 5% CO(2), before and after intraperitoneal administration of amiodarone, lamotrigine, phenytoin, or vehicle. Lamotrigine (10 microM) and phenytoin (5 microM), but not amiodarone (5 microM), decreased chemoreceptor AP frequency without affecting other AP parameters or magnitude of catecholamine secretion.

Epileptogenesis is a process that includes molecular and cellular events that foster the establishment of hyperexcitable neuronal networks in the brain. Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling model in rodents has added new information to the knowledge about the pathogenesis of epilepsy and potential targets of novel antiepileptic agents. Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that oxidative and inflammatory events may play important roles in the initiation and maintaining seizure activities. Vitamin B12 has beneficial effects on the nervous system and presents pleiotropic effects with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory aspects. In the present study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that vitamin B12 and their combination with lamotrigine prevents behavioral deficits, hippocampal damage, oxidation, and proinflammatory state during epileptogenesis. Male rats were subjected to PTZ-induced epileptogenesis and pretreated with vitamin B12 (50 ug/kg) or Lamotrigine (LTG) (25 mg/kg) or B12 (50 ug/kg) + LTG (25 mg/kg). Vitamin B12 and its combination with LTG suppressed epileptogenesis and improved the performance of rats in the passive avoidance test. In addition, Vitamin B12 and its combination with LTG decreased levels of total oxidative status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and increased total antioxidant status (TAS) levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Furthermore, it reduced hippocampal neuronal damage.

Cognitive impairment is frequently observed in epileptic patients. It has been seen that not only epilepsy but antiepileptic drugs also impair cognitive functions. The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of three anticonvulsants viz. lamotrigine (5mg/kg, p.o.), oxcarbazepine (15mg/kg, p.o.) and topiramate (10mg/kg, p.o.) on cognitive function and oxidative stress during pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling in mice. Kindling was induced by the administration of PTZ (25mg/kg, i.p.) on every alternate day till 5 weeks. Cognition was assessed after the development of kindling. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and passive avoidance response (PAR) tests were carried out after 24h and 48h of the last PTZ administration. After completion of behavioural tests malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity were measured as an indicator of oxidative stress. The results of the present study indicate that topiramate (10mg/kg) administration to kindled animals increased transfer latency and decreased step-down latency in EPM and PAR tests, respectively. However, lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine did not alter the two parameters. Topiramate administration to kindled as well as non-kindled animals has shown increase in MDA and decrease in glutathione levels. Lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine did not show significant alteration in oxidative stress parameters. To conclude, long term administration of topiramate impairs cognitive functions during experimental epilepsy while lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine are safer.

In this communication, the effect of acute treatment with lamotrigine (LTG) was investigated on release of main excitatory amino acids (EAA) such as glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) in the hippocampus of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced and PTZ-kindled freely moving rats using micro dialysis. The results show that, levels of Glu and Asp significantly increased in the rat hippocampus during the seizure/interical periods for PTZ-status epilepticus (SE) and PTZ-kindled epileptic (EP) rats. The levels of Glu and Asp increased more in EP rat hippocampus than in SE rat hippocampus. After administration of 20 mg/kg LTG, the levels of Glu and Asp significantly decreased in the SE and EP rat hippocampus.

', 'Effect of lamotrigine on seizure development in a rat pentylenetetrazole kindling model. Epileptogenesis is a process of seizure development. Lamotrigine is a novel antiepileptic drug which is also used for antiepileptogenic research. Kindling models are recommended as potentially useful tools for antiepileptogenic treatment discovery. However, previous studies demonstrated that the antiepileptogenic effect of lamotrigine is controversial in the electrical kindling model. Chemical kindling such as with pentylenetetrazole is another kindling model. The aims of this study were to examine whether lamotrigine could prevent the development of seizure in pentylenetetrazole kindling rats. Female rats were kindled by subconvulsive doses of pentylenetetrazole (35 mg/kg) once every other day for 15 times. Thereafter, the kindled rats received different doses of lamotrigine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) before pentylenetetrazole to observe the anticonvulsant effect. For the antiepileptogenic experiment, rats were kindled as the same way while pretreated (1 h) with different doses of lamotrigine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) before each injection of pentylenetetrazole. After a washout period for 1 week, the rats were administrated with pentylenetetrazole again for 3 times. The seizures were recorded each time. Later it was in vivo electrophysiological experiments followed with histologic analysis. For the anticonvulsant experiment lamotrigine dose-dependently suppressed pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. Here, 20 mg/kg of lamotrigine pretreatment significantly blocked the seizure development in rats for their seizure stages remained longer in 1-3 during the kindling phase. Mean seizure stages or generalized seizure durations in the 10 and 20 mg/kg lamotrigine pretreated groups were significantly lower or shorter when received 3 times of pentylenetetrazole after the washout period. Electrophysiological study also demonstrated 20 mg/kg of lamotrigine pretreatment obviously eliminated increased population spike amplitude in hippocampus. However, different doses of lamotrigine pretreatment could not alleviate severity of hippocampal neuronal damage. The results suggest that adequate doses of lamotrigine can prevent seizure development in the pentylenetetrazole kindling rat model. ', 'Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and neurochemical investigations of lamotrigine-pentylenetetrazole kindled mice to ascertain it as a reliable model for clinical drug-resistant epilepsy. Pentylenetetrazole kindling has long been used for the screening of investigational antiseizure drugs. The presence of lamotrigine, at a very low dose, does not hamper kindling in mice; rather it modifies this epileptogenesis process into drug-resistant epilepsy. The lamotrigine-pentylenetetrazole kindled mice show resistance to lamotrigine, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. It may also be possible that other licensed antiseizure drugs, like the mentioned drugs, remain ineffective in this model; therefore, this was the subject of this study. Swiss albino mice were kindled with pentylenetetrazole for 35 days in the presence of either methylcellulose vehicle or lamotrigine (subtherapeutic dose, ie, 5 mg/kg). Vehicle vs lamotrigine-kindled mice were compared in terms of (a) resistance/response toward nine antiseizure drugs applied as monotherapies and two drug combinations; (b) lamotrigine bioavailability in blood and brain; (c) blood-brain barrier integrity; and (d) amino acids and monoamines in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Lamotrigine vs vehicle-kindled mice are similar (or not significantly different P > .05 from each other) in terms of (a) response toward drug combinations; (b) lamotrigine bioavailability; and (c) blood-brain barrier integrity except for, significantly (P < .05) reduced taurine and increased glutamate in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Aside from these, lamotrigine-kindled mice show significant (P < .05) resistant to lamotrigine (15 mg/kg), levetiracetam (40 mg/kg); carbamazepine (40 mg/kg), zonisamide (100 mg/kg), gabapentin (224 mg/kg), pregabalin (30 mg/kg), phenytoin (35 mg/kg), and topiramate (300 mg/kg). Lamotrigine-pentylenetetrazole kindling takes longer to develop (~5 weeks) in comparison to lamotrigine-amygdale (~4 weeks) and lamotrigine-corneal (~2 weeks) kindling models. However, drug screening through this model may yield superior drugs with novel antiseizure mechanisms.

', 'Effect of lamotrigine on epilepsy-induced cognitive impairment and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in pentylenetetrazole-kindled animal model. Lamotrigine (LTG) is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug that is widely used in clinic. However, the effect of LTG on cognition and neurodegeneration during epilepsy treatment remains controversial. In this study, we compared the cognitive effects of LTG and sodium valproate in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindled animal model, and the dose dependency was tested for LTG. PTZ-kindled animals were divided into the following treatment groups: control group, treated with 3.5 mL/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride; low-dose LTG group, treated with 12.5 mg/kg of LTG; middle-dose LTG group, treated with 25 mg/kg of LTG; high-dose LTG group, treated with 50 mg/kg of LTG; VPA group, treated with 300 mg/kg of VPA. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) test commenced from the 10th day of treatment. Hippocampal cell apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining after two weeks of treatment. Compared to the vehicle-treated control group, escape latency was significantly reduced in the middle- and high-dose LTG- and VPA-treated groups on the 3rd and 4th day of the MWM test (p < .05), and spatial probe frequency was significantly improved in the middle- and high-dose LTG- and VPA-treated groups (p < .05). Furthermore, the immunohistochemical score of TUNEL positive cells significantly decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region in the middle- and high-dose LTG- and VPA-treated groups (p < .05). Our data suggests that LTG may ameliorate epilepsy-induced cognitive impairment and neuronal cell apoptosis during epilepsy treatment. LTG may ameliorate cognitive impairment and neuronal cell apoptosis during epilepsy treatment. ', 'Vitamin D enhances antiepileptic and cognitive effects of lamotrigine in pentylenetetrazole-kindled rats. Despite long use of antiepileptic drugs, it remains a challenge to achieve seizure control while reducing adverse effects and preventing cognitive impairment. Several lines of evidence suggest a role of vitamin D in epilepsy. So this study aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D on epileptogenesis, cognitive dysfunction and antiepileptic activity of lamotrigine, in a rat model of chemical kindling. Rats were kindled by pentylenetetrazole injections every other day over four weeks, together with daily oral treatment by either vehicle, vitamin D, lamotrigine or combination of vitamin D and lamotrigine. The non-treated kindled rats developed generalized seizures and had poor cognitive performance in water maze, associated with prooxidative status; elevated malondialdehyde and nitric oxide with lowered glutathione levels; in brain tissues. Treatment with either vitamin D, lamotrigine or both leads to significant reduction of seizure activity score, improvement of cognitive performance, and amelioration of the disturbed oxidative stress biomarkers. These findings indicate that, vitamin D has anti-epileptic, cognitive improving and antioxidant effects, on its own and enhance the effects of lamotrigine, in a chronic model of epileptic seizures. Thus, vitamin D supplementation may be a useful addition to antiepileptic drugs improving seizure control and cognitive function in patients with epilepsy. ', '', '']\n",

The maximal slope conductance normalized to cell capacitance was 0.509 +/- 0.019 nS/pE After exposure to both DAM (50 microM; n = 8) and AMI (50 microM; n = 7), rapid decrease in inward IK1 was observed. Block was restricted almost exclusively to the inward component. DAM caused a significant reduction of the maximal inward current (-20.0 +/- 2.0 pA/pF; p < 0.05), whereas AMI induced an even greater reduction of the same component (-14.1 +/- 1.2 pA/pF; p < 0.05 with respect to control and to DAM). The outward component of IK1 was not changed by either AMI or DAM (4.0 +/- 0.3 pA/pF and 3.4 +/- 0.4 pA/pF, respectively). AMI and DAM also decreased the maximal slope conductance significantly (0.297 +/- 0.019 nS/pF and 0.421 +/- 0.038 nS/pF, respectively). In addition, AMI but not DAM significantly increased the tau(a). However, the voltage dependence of the acceleration of tau(a) remained unchanged after both AMI and DAM exposure. These results allow us to conclude that AMI may induce a greater increase in the resting Rm than its main metabolite. This effect may counterbalance, at least in part, the conduction slowing due to its sodium channel-blocking properties. ']\n",

Dexamethasone produces anti-secretory responses in airway epithelium through the inhibition of basolateral membrane K+ channels [1-3]. We have used the human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o- to investigate the effects of dexamethasone on the expression of K+ channels and regulatory protein kinases. The data demonstrate the expression of three distinct K+ channel types - KCNQ1:KCNE3, KCNN4 and KATP which are differentially regulated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C. The data also provide evidence for rapid non-genomic actions of dexamethasone on PKC and PKA phosphorylation and their association with the various K+ channel sub-types. Biotinylation experiments provide data on the effects of dexamethasone on membrane expression of the K+ channels. Antibody co-immunoprecipitation, rtPCR and western blotting data are given for the non-genomic dexamethasone transcription-cell signaling pathway involving Gi-protein coupled receptor, PKC, adenylyl cyclase Type IV, cAMP, PKA and ERK1/2 activation. ', 'Role of cholinergic-activated KCa1.1 (BK), KCa3.1 (SK4) and KV7.1 (KCNQ1) channels in mouse colonic Cl- secretion. Colonic crypts are the site of Cl- secretion. Basolateral K+ channels provide the driving force for luminal cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-mediated Cl- exit. Relevant colonic epithelial K+ channels are the intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K(Ca)3.1 (SK4) channel and the cAMP-activated K(V)7.1 (KCNQ1) channel. In addition, big conductance Ca2+-activated K(Ca)1.1 (BK) channels may play a role in Ca2+-activated Cl- secretion. Here we use K(Ca)1.1 and K(Ca)3.1 knock-out mice, and the K(V)7.1 channel inhibitor 293B (10 microm) to investigate the role of K(Ca)1.1, K(Ca)3.1 and K(V)7.1 channels in cholinergic-stimulated Cl- secretion. A Ussing chamber was used to quantify agonist-stimulated increases in short circuit current (Isc) in distal colon. Chloride secretion was activated by bl. forskolin (FSK, 2 microm) followed by bl. carbachol (CCH, 100 microm). Luminal Ba2+ (5 mm) was used to inhibit K(Ca)1.1 channels. K(Ca)1.1 WT and KO mice displayed identical FSK and CCH-stimulated Isc changes, indicating that K(Ca)1.1 channels are not involved in FSK- and cholinergic-stimulated Cl- secretion. CCH-stimulated DeltaIsc was significantly reduced in K(Ca)3.1 KO mice, underscoring the known relevance of this channel in the activation of Cl- secretion by an intracellular Ca2+ increasing agonist. The residual CCH effect observed in K(Ca)3.1 KO mice suggests that yet another K+ channel is driving the CCH-stimulated Cl- secretion. In the presence of the specific K(V)7.1 channel blocker 293B, the residual CCH effect was abolished. This demonstrates that both K(Ca)3.1 and K(V)7.1 channels are activated by cholinergic agonists and drive Cl- secretion. In contrast, K(Ca)1.1 channels are not involved in stimulated electrogenic Cl- secretion. ', 'Dexamethasone reduces airway epithelial Cl- secretion by rapid non-genomic inhibition of KCNQ1, KCNN4 and KATP K+ channels. Basolateral membrane K+ channels play a key role in basal and agonist stimulated Cl- transport across airway epithelial cells by generating a favourable electrical driving force for Cl- efflux. The K+ channel sub-types and molecular mechanisms of regulation by hormones and secretagoues are still poorly understood. Here we have identified the type of K+ channels involved in cAMP and Ca2+ stimulated Cl- secretion and uncovered a novel anti-secretory effect of dexamethasone mediated by inhibition of basolateral membrane K+ channels in a human airway cell model of 16HBE14o- cells commonly used for ion transport studies. Dexamethasone produced a rapid inhibition of transepithelial chloride ion secretion under steady state conditions and after stimulation with cAMP agonist (forskolin) or a Ca2+ mobilizing agonist (ATP). Our results show three different types of K+ channels are targeted by dexamethasone to reduce airway secretion, namely Ca2+-activated secretion via KCNN4 (KCa3.1) channels and cAMP-activated secretion via KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) and KATP (Kir6.1,6.2) channels. The down-regulation of KCNN4 and KCNQ1 channel activities by dexamethasone involves rapid non-genomic activation of PKCalpha and PKA signalling pathways, respectively. Dexamethasone signal transduction for PKC and PKA activation was demonstrated to occur through a rapid non-genomic pathway that did not implicate the classical nuclear receptors for glucocorticoids or mineralocorticoids but occurred via a novel signalling cascade involving sequentially a Gi-protein coupled receptor, PKC, adenylyl cyclase Type IV, cAMP, PKA and ERK1/2 activation. The rapid, non-genomic, effects of dexamethasone on airway epithelial ion transport and cell signalling introduces a new paradigm for glucocorticoid actions in lung epithelia which may serve to augment the anti-inflammatory activity of the steroid and enhance its therapeutic potential in treating airway hypersecretion in asthma and COPD.

      "PMID Texts: ['Interactions of the antimalarial drug mefloquine with the human cardiac potassium channels KvLQT1/minK and HERG. Mefloquine is a quinoline antimalarial drug that is structurally related to the antiarrhythmic agent quinidine. Mefloquine is widely used in both the treatment and prophylaxis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Mefloquine can prolong cardiac repolarization, especially when coadministered with halofantrine, an antagonist of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) cardiac K+ channel. For these reasons we examined the effects of mefloquine on the slow delayed rectifier K+ channel (KvQT1/minK) and HERG, the K+ channels that underlie the slow (I(Ks)) and rapid (I(Kr)) components of repolarization in the human myocardium, respectively. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology we found that mefloquine inhibited KvLQT1/minK channel currents with an IC50 value of approximately 1 microM. Mefloquine slowed the activation rate of KvLQT1/minK and more block was evident at lower membrane potentials compared with higher ones. When channels were held in the closed state during drug application, block was immediate and complete with the first depolarizing step. HERG channel currents were about 6-fold less sensitive to block by mefloquine (IC50 = 5.6 microM). Block of HERG displayed a positive voltage dependence with maximal inhibition obtained at more depolarized potentials. In contrast to structurally related drugs such as quinidine, mefloquine is a more effective antagonist of KvLQT1/minK compared with HERG. Block of KvLQT1/minK by mefloquine may involve an interaction with the closed state of the channel. Inhibition by mefloquine of KvLQT1/minK in the human heart may in part explain the synergistic prolongation of QT interval observed when this drug is coadministered with the HERG antagonist halofantrine. ', \"Action potential clamp and mefloquine sensitivity of recombinant 'I KS' channels incorporating the V307L KCNQ1 mutation. The slow delayed rectifier potassium current, 'I(Ks)', contributes to repolarisation of cardiac ventricular action potentials and thereby to the duration of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Mutations to I(Ks) channel subunits occur in clinically significant cardiac repolarisation disorders. The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is associated with accelerated ventricular repolarisation and with an increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden death. The SQT2 variant of the SQTS has been linked to a gain-of-function amino-acid substitution (V307L) in the KCNQ1-encoded I(Ks) channel alpha-subunit. This study reports the first action potential (AP) voltage-clamp comparison between wild-type (WT) and V307L KCNQ1 (co-expressed with KCNE1 to recapitulate I(Ks)) and identifies an effective pharmacological inhibitor of recombinant 'I(Ks)' channels incorporating the V307L KCNQ1 mutation. Perforated-patch voltage-clamp recordings at 37 degrees C of whole-cell current carried by co-expressed KCNQ1 and KCNE1 showed a marked (-36 mV) shift in half-maximal activation for V307L compared to WT KCNQ1; a significant slowing of current deactivation was also observed. Under AP clamp, peak repolarising current was significantly augmented for V307L KCNQ1 compared to WT KCNQ1 for both ventricular and atrial AP commands, consistent with an ability of the V307L mutation to increase repolarising I(Ks) in both regions. The quinoline agent mefloquine inhibited WT KCNQ1+KCNE1 with an IC(50) of 3.4 muM compared to 3.3 muM for V307L KCNQ1+KCNE1 (P >0.05). This establishes mefloquine as an effective inhibitor of recombinant 'I(Ks)' channels incorporating this SQT2 KCNQ1 mutation. \"]\n",

Although amiodarone (AMD) is known to produce drug-drug interactions through inhibition of transporter-mediated excretion of drugs, its impact on these mechanisms during chronic treatment has not been described yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of AMD pretreatment on the main multidrug transporting proteins, Mdr1 and Mrp2, in the liver and kidney. The expression of the transporters and pharmacokinetics of their substrates, rhodamine-123 (Rho123) and endogenous conjugated bilirubin (CB), were evaluated in rats after either AMD oral pretreatments (4-14 days) or single intravenous bolus. AMD pretreatment of all durations up-regulated renal Mdr1 and Mrp2 protein expression to 155-190% and 152-223% of the control values, respectively. In agreement, we observed a corresponding increase in renal clearance of both substrates. Hepatic expression was increased only for Mdr1 to 234-270% of controls, which was associated with increased biliary elimination of amiodarone without change in Rho123 biliary clearance. Interestingly, hepatic expression of another Mdr transporter, Mdr2, was progressively decreased by amiodarone administration. Acute administration of AMD reduced Rho123 biliary clearance by 64%. Our results indicate that repeated administration of AMD to rats is associated with significant increase in hepatic and renal expression of Mdr1 and Mrp2 transporters, which may contribute to variability in pharmacokinetics of AMD and simultaneously applied drugs.

To find new anti-cancer drug therapies, we wanted to exploit homeostatic vulnerabilities within Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2)-deficient cells with mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) hyperactivity. We show that nelfinavir and mefloquine synergize to selectively evoke a cytotoxic response in TSC2-deficient cell lines with mTORC1 hyperactivity. We optimize the concentrations of nelfinavir and mefloquine to a clinically viable range that kill cells that lack TSC2, while wild-type cells tolerate treatment. This new clinically viable drug combination causes a significant level of cell death in TSC2-deficient tumor spheroids. Furthermore, no cell recovery was apparent after drug withdrawal, revealing potent cytotoxicity. Transcriptional profiling by RNA sequencing of drug treated TSC2-deficient cells compared to wild-type cells suggested the cytotoxic mechanism of action, involving initial ER stress and an imbalance in energy homeostatic pathways. Further characterization revealed that supplementation with methyl pyruvate alleviated energy stress and reduced the cytotoxic effect, implicating energy deprivation as the trigger of cell death. This work underpins a critical vulnerability with cancer cells with aberrant signaling through the TSC2-mTORC1 pathway that lack flexibility in homeostatic pathways, which could be exploited with combined nelfinavir and mefloquine treatment.

Increases in dose led to a higher efficacy rate for PVC suppression with a corresponding increase in side effects with mexiletine; with procainamide, the higher dose was not associated with greater PVC suppression. In group II patients, mexiletine was effective in 4 (16%), with one patient discontinuing the drug during long-term therapy; mexiletine was ineffective in 16 (64%) and early side effects developed in 5 (20%). Patients not responding to or not tolerating mexiletine were given amiodarone; 20 of 21 (95%) responded with arrhythmia control after the loading dose. During a mean follow-up period of 2 years, sudden death occurred in two patients, death from heart failure in two, and death from subarachnoid hemorrhage in one patient; 15 (75%) patients are alive and free of arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ', 'New antiarrhythmic drugs: tocainide, mexiletine, flecainide, encainide, and amiodarone. Tocainide, mexiletine, flecainide, encainide, and amiodarone are antiarrhythmic agents that have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for general use in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. All five agents are effective in the treatment of patients with ventricular arrhythmias, whereas encainide, flecainide, and amiodarone are also useful in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias and the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (although not yet approved for these indications). Tocainide and mexiletine are similar to lidocaine and are as effective as quinidine in patients with ventricular arrhythmias. Encainide and flecainide are superior to quinidine for the control of ventricular ectopic beats and as effective as quinidine for patients with ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone is the most effective agent available for treating patients with ventricular tachycardia, but it is also the most toxic antiarrhythmic agent and should be used only when other antiarrhythmic drugs have not been effective or tolerated.

The most effective pharmacological management of frequent ventricular tachyarrhythmia events in patients with an implantable defibrillator who failed or did not tolerate amiodarone is unknown. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of mexiletine in such patients. The patients served as self-controls. The number of treated ventricular tachyarrhythmia episodes (primary outcome); mortality, shocks from the defibrillator, and electrical storm events (secondary outcomes) during mexiletine therapy was compared with a matched duration of observation just before initiating mexiletine in 29 patients who were treated with a median dose of 300 mg/d of mexiletine and were followed for a median of 12 months. None of the patients had to stop mexiletine due to side effect. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation episodes (median 2 vs. 12 events, P = 0.001) and shocks (median 0 vs. 2 events, P = 0.003) in the first 3 months of treatment, but long-term efficacy was only observed among patients who continued amiodarone therapy. In conclusion, mexiletine, when added to amiodarone in case of amiodarone inefficacy, reduces ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation events and appropriate therapies in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. A randomized trial should validate the efficacy and safety of mexiletine as an adjunctive therapy to amiodarone. ', 'Electrophysiologic effects of procainamide, mexiletine, and amiodarone on the transplanted heart. Experimental study. The effects of procainamide, mexiletine, and amiodarone on automaticity, conduction, and refractoriness were studied in a model of heterotopic heart transplantation in dogs that combined an innervated heart (recipient) and a denervated transplanted heart (donor). After the surgical procedure, 500 mg procainamide (n = 13), 200 mg plus 0.1 mg/kg per minute mexiletine (n = 10), or 150 mg amiodarone (n = 10) was administered intravenously. During a baseline period and after drug administration, each heart was assessed for atrioventricular interval; cycle length; sinoatrial conduction time; atrioventricular node anterograde and retrograde block points; atrioventricular node and ventricular antegrade effective refractory periods; PR, QRS, and QT intervals on electrocardiogram; systemic arterial, pulmonary arterial, central venous, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures; and cardiac output. In recipients, procainamide reduced cardiac output, depressed sinus automaticity, slowed conduction time without affecting the QRS interval, and prolonged the nodal and ventricular refractoriness; in donor hearts, it depressed automaticity and prolonged nodal refractoriness, but did not modify conduction or ventricular refractoriness. Mexiletine only moderately depressed sinus automaticity in recipient hearts; it did not affect the other parameters either in recipient or transplanted hearts, nor did it alter the hemodynamic situation. Amiodarone produced hypotension, reduced cardiac output, and prolonged all the electrophysiologic intervals except the QRS interval in recipient hearts. These changes were even more pronounced in the transplanted hearts and led to extreme sinus bradycardia in four cases. Of these three drugs, mexiletine appears to be the safest should treatment for arrhythmias be necessary in transplant recipients.

Amiodarone has pharmacokinetic interactions with various therapeutic agents, including phenytoin, flecainide, and cyclosporine. Mexiletine is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of amiodarone on the pharmacokinetics of mexiletine through its inhibition of various cytochrome P450 (CYP) subtypes. In a series of 181 inpatients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, 26 inpatients received mexiletine and amiodarone therapy (MEX + AMD group), and the others received mexiletine therapy (MEX group). In 10 inpatients of the MEX + AMD group, the mexiletine clearance (CL(MEX)/F) before and after coadministration of amiodarone was compared. CL(MEX)/F was also compared in the MEX and MEX + AMD groups after the start of amiodarone therapy. Serum mexiletine, amiodarone, and desethylamiodarone concentrations were measured by an HPLC method. The CL(MEX)/F was estimated by the Bayesian method using population pharmacokinetic analysis. There was no significant difference in CL(MEX)/F before and after 1-month coadministration of amiodarone in 10 inpatients of the MEX + AMD group. Although serum amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations gradually increased with time after the start of amiodarone therapy in these patients, CL(MEX)/F showed no change at 3 and 5 months after the start of amiodarone therapy. There was no significant difference in CL(MEX)/F of the MEX group and the MEX + AMD group. The results suggest that the pharmacokinetics of mexiletine is not affected by amiodarone in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. ', 'Comparative antiarrhythmic efficacy of verapamil, 17-monochloracetylajmaline, mexiletine and amiodarone in patients with severe chagasic myocarditis: relation with the underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms. The antiarrhythmic effects of verapamil, 17-monochloracetylajmaline, mexiletine and amiodarone were compared in 14 patients with chagasic myocarditis. Drugs and placebo were administered orally in the following order: placebo and verapamil, placebo and 17-monochloracetylajmaline, placebo and mexiletine (1 week each) and placebo and amiodarone (4 weeks each). A 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording was obtained after administration of each placebo and drug. Verapamil had no effect on the number of ventricular premature complexes, ventricular couplets and runs of ventricular tachycardia. 17-Monochloracetylajmaline did not reduce the number of ventricular premature complexes and ventricular couplets but caused a moderate reduction in runs of ventricular tachycardia. Mexiletine failed to significantly reduce ventricular premature complexes but caused a moderate decrease in both ventricular couplets and runs of ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone was the only one of the four drugs that caused a substantial reduction of ventricular premature complexes (logarithmic mean 97.8%; p less than 0.001), total suppression of runs of ventricular tachycardia in 11 of 11 patients and suppression of ventricular couplets in 8 of 14 patients and a significant reduction in the remaining 6 patients. The much greater efficacy of amiodarone as compared with the two sodium channel modifiers (17-monochloracetylajmaline and mexiletine) and one calcium channel blocker (verapamil) suggests that its potent antiarrhythmic activity is probably related to other peculiar and still undefined electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties. ', 'Combined mexiletine and amiodarone treatment of refractory recurrent ventricular tachycardia. A combined mexiletine and amiodarone treatment was applied in nine cases with recurrent refractory ventricular tachycardia. During the first two days of treatment, mexiletine and amiodarone were perfused intravenously at a dose of 1,000 mg. and 1,500 mg. per 24 hours, respectively. Simultaneously amiodarone was also given orally at a dose of 600 mg. per 24 hours. From the third day onwards, the intravenous administration was interrupted and both drugs were continued orally at a dose of 600 mg. daily. The first three patients were very critically ill and had had at least five episodes of ventricular tachycardia per 24 hours during the last 10 days in the intensive care unit. The treatment resulted in total suppression of the tachycardic episodes within three days after initiation of therapy. In the remaining six cases, ventricular tachycardia was easily initiated by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart. No arrhythmia could be elicited by repeated testing on the seventh day of treatment. The mean follow-up period was 6 months. Two patients with poor left ventricular function died in intractable heart failure. Another one died suddenly 4-1/2 months after his release from the hospital. He had a large aneurysm and whether he continued his treatment is unknown. A fourth patient had an aneurysmectomy; he suffered a recurrence, and died at his second operation. All the others presently remain asymptomatic. The association of a class I (mexiletine) with a class III (amiodarone) agent is theoretically attractive for the treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias. The present findings corroborate this hypothesis, but show that this association is not able to protect individuals with severe underlying myocardial damage. ']\n",

Transient outward K+ current, Ito, contributes to cardiac action potential generation and is primarily carried by Kv4.3 (KCND3) channels. Two Kv4.3 isoforms are expressed in human ventricle and show differential remodeling in heart failure (HF). Lidocaine and mexiletine may be applied in selected patients to suppress ventricular arrhythmias, without effects on sudden cardiac death or mortality. Isoform-dependent effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on Kv4.3 channels and potential implications for remodeling-based antiarrhythmic management have not been assessed to date. We sought to test the hypotheses that Kv4.3 channels are targeted by lidocaine and mexiletine, and that drug sensitivity is determined in isoform-specific manner. Expression of KCND3 isoforms was quantified using qRT-PCR in left ventricular samples of patients with HF due to either ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathies (ICM or DCM). Long (Kv4.3-L) and short (Kv4.3-S) isoforms were heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes to study drug sensitivity and effects on biophysical characteristics activation, deactivation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation. In the present HF patient cohort KCND3 isoform expression did not differ between ICM and DCM. In vitro, lidocaine (IC50-Kv4.3-L: 0.8 mM; IC50-Kv4.3-S: 1.2 mM) and mexiletine (IC50-Kv4.3-L: 146 muM; IC50-Kv4.3-S: 160 muM) inhibited Kv4.3 with different sensitivity. Biophysical analyses identified accelerated and enhanced inactivation combined with delayed recovery from inactivation as primary biophysical mechanisms underlying Kv4.3 current reduction. In conclusion, differential effects on Kv4.3 isoforms extend the electropharmacological profile of lidocaine and mexiletine. Patient-specific remodeling of Kv4.3 isoforms may determine individual drug responses and requires consideration during clinical application of compounds targeting Kv4.3. ']\n",

Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of the most lethal transmissible infections characterized by a high fatality rate, and a treatment has not been developed yet. Recently, it has been shown that cationic amphiphiles, among them the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone, inhibit filovirus infection. In the present work, we investigated how amiodarone interferes with Ebola virus infection. Wild-type Sudan ebolavirus and recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, pseudotyped with the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein, were used to gain further insight into the ability of amiodarone to affect Ebola virus infection. We show that amiodarone decreases Ebola virus infection at concentrations close to those found in the sera of patients treated for arrhythmias. The drug acts by interfering with the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. We also show that MDEA, the main amiodarone metabolite, contributes to the antiviral activity. Finally, studies with amiodarone analogues indicate that the antiviral activity is correlated with drug ability to accumulate into and interfere with the endocytic pathway. Considering that it is well tolerated, especially in the acute setting, amiodarone appears to deserve consideration for clinical use in EVD. ']\n",

Malaria treatment is recommended for patients with suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa, whether systeomatically or based on confirmed malaria diagnosis. At the Ebola treatment center in Foya, Lofa County, Liberia, the supply of artemether-lumefantrine, a first-line antimalarial combination drug, ran out for a 12-day period in August 2014. During this time, patients received the combination drug artesunate-amodiaquine; amodiaquine is a compound with anti-Ebola virus activity in vitro. No other obvious change in the care of patients occurred during this period. We fit unadjusted and adjusted regression models to standardized patient-level data to estimate the risk ratio for death among patients with confirmed EVD who were prescribed artesunate-amodiaquine (artesunate-amodiaquine group), as compared with those who were prescribed artemether-lumefantrine (artemether-lumefantrine group) and those who were not prescribed any antimalarial drug (no-antimalarial group). Between June 5 and October 24, 2014, a total of 382 patients with confirmed EVD were admitted to the Ebola treatment center in Foya. At admission, 194 patients were prescribed artemether-lumefantrine and 71 were prescribed artesunate-amodiaquine. The characteristics of the patients in the artesunate-amodiaquine group were similar to those in the artemether-lumefantrine group and those in the no-antimalarial group. A total of 125 of the 194 patients in the artemether-lumefantrine group (64.4%) died, as compared with 36 of the 71 patients in the artesunate-amodiaquine group (50.7%).

Patients who were prescribed artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death from EVD than did patients who were prescribed artemether-lumefantrine. However, our analyses cannot exclude the possibility that artemether-lumefantrine is associated with an increased risk of death or that the use of artesunate-amodiaquine was associated with unmeasured patient characteristics that directly altered the risk of death. ', 'In Vivo Activity of Amodiaquine against Ebola Virus Infection. During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Western Africa (2013-2016), antimalarial treatment was administered to EVD patients due to the high coexisting malaria burden in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine. As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine. Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections. We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD. Using a similar 3-day antimalarial dosing strategy as for human patients, plasma concentrations of amodiaquine in healthy animals were similar to those found in humans. However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals. While amodiaquine on its own failed to demonstrate efficacy, we cannot exclude potential therapeutic value of amodiaquine when used in combination with artesunate or another antiviral. ', 'Novel amodiaquine derivatives potently inhibit Ebola virus infection. Ebola virus disease is a severe disease caused by highly pathogenic Ebolaviruses. Although it shows a high mortality rate in humans, currently there is no licensed therapeutic. During the recent epidemic in West Africa, it was demonstrated that administration of antimalarial medication containing amodiaquine significantly lowered mortality rate of patients infected with the virus. Here, in order to improve its antiviral activity, a series of amodiaquine derivatives were synthesized and tested for Ebola virus infection. We found that multiple compounds were more potent than amodiaquine. The structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the two independent parts, which are the alkyl chains extending from the aminomethyl group and a halogen bonded to the quinoline ring, were keys for enhancing antiviral potency without increasing toxicity. When these modifications were combined, the antiviral efficacy could be further improved with the selectivity indexes being over 10-times higher than amodiaquine. Mechanistic evaluation demonstrated that the potent derivatives blocked host cell entry of Ebola virus, like the parental amodiaquine. Taken together, our work identified novel potent amodiaquine derivatives, which will aid in further development of effective antiviral therapeutics.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the ASAQ MDAs on the mortality of patients with EVD. A retrospective cohort design was used to analyze mortality data for patients with EVD admitted to 5 Ebola treatment units in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Patients admitted to the ETUs during the time period of ASAQ's therapeutic effect from areas where the MDA was implemented were matched to controls not exposed to ASAQ, using a range of covariates, including malaria co-infection status, and a logistic regression analysis was performed.

Pfmdr1 86Y and haplotypes at Pfcrt 72-76 have been linked to chloroquine (CQ) as well as amodiaquine (AQ) resistance. mefloquine (MQ) and lumefantrine (LU) sensitivities are linked to Pfmdr1 86Y. Additionally, Pfcrt K76 allele carrying parasites have shown tolerance to LU. We investigated the association between Pfmdr1 86/Pfcrt 72-76 and P. falciparum resistance to CQ, AQ, MQ and LU using field samples collected during 2008-2011 from malaria endemic sites in western Kenya. Genomic DNA from these samples was genotyped to examine SNPs and haplotypes in Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt respectively. Additionally, immediate ex vivo and in vitro drug sensitivity profiles were assessed using the malaria SYBR Green I fluorescence-based assay. We observed a rapid but steady percent increase in wild-type parasites with regard to both Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt between 2008 and 2011 (p<0.0001). Equally, a significant reciprocate decrease in AQ and CQ median IC50 values occurred (p<0.0001) during the same period. Thus, the data in this study point to a significantly rapid change in parasite response to AQ and CQ in the study period. This may be due to releasing of drug pressure on the parasite from reduced use of AQ in the face of increased Artemisinin (ART) Combination Therapy (ACT) administration following the intervention of the Global Fund in 2008. LU has been shown to select for 76K genotypes, thus the observed increase in 76K genotypes coupled with significant cross resistance between LU and MQ, may herald emergence of tolerance against both drugs in future.

This study concerns the in vitro interaction with human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) of amodiaquine, chloroquine, and mefloquine, three antimalarial drugs currently in use for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria. It was found that mefloquine (100 and 50 micrograms/ml) significantly altered PMN viability while the other two drugs did not. Neutrophil chemotaxis was impaired by chloroquine (100 micrograms/ml) and mefloquine (greater than 10 micrograms/ml) but not by amodiaquine. Phagocytosis was decreased by about 50% in the presence of chloroquine (100 micrograms/ml) or mefloquine (10 micrograms/ml). The three antimalarial drugs altered neutrophil oxidative metabolism as assessed by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence. The strongest effect was observed with mefloquine, which abolished almost completely the neutrophil burst at concentrations of greater than 10 micrograms/ml whatever the stimulus used. This effect was not reversed by washing. Chloroquine and amodiaquine also impaired this PMN response by approximately 80 and 50%, respectively, but only at the highest concentration used (100 micrograms/ml). In the case of amodiaquine, the neutrophil response was restored by washing, except for stimulation with opsonized particles. After washing, the depressive effect of chloroquine was reversed completely in the case of phorbol myristate acetate stimulation and partly in the case of opsonized particle stimulation, but the formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced response was not restored. These data show that although they are structurally related, amodiaquine and chloroquine exhibit qualitatively and quantitatively different depressive effects on PMN function and probably interfere at different points of cell activation, although the precise mechanisms are as yet unresolved.

Between March 1990 and June 1992, a study was carried out in Equatorial Guinea on the in vitro response of Plasmodium falciparum to different antimalarial drugs. Field work for the study was conducted both in the country's island region as well as on the mainland, and resistant isolates were found to exhibit interregional differences. On the island of Bioko, 204 tests were performed with 16% (11 of 69) resistant to chloroquine, 9% (4 of 46) resistant to quinine, 14% (6 of 43) resistant to a combination of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and 6.5% (3 of 46) resistant to amodiaquine. In the mainland area of Bata, the same antimalarial drugs and mefloquine were tested with the following results: 9% (5 of 58) resistant to chloroquine; 2% (1 of 58) resistant to amodiaquine, and 3% (2 of 58) resistant to a combination of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. No isolates resistant to quinine or mefloquine were found. Effective concentrations (EC50, EC90, and EC99) and regression lines (log dose/response) for each antimalarial drug were calculated to establish a surveillance system for antimalarial drug chemosensitivity in Equatorial Guinea. Finally, 12 isolates from 12 patients previously treated with chloroquine were studied to compare both tests (in vivo-in vitro) and obtain a correlation between the RII and RIII types of in vivo and in vitro resistances. No correlation for the RI type was found between the two methods. \"]\n",

Dantrolene was introduced for treatment of malignant hyperthermia. It also has antiarrhythmic properties and may thus be an alternative to amiodarone for the treatment of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Aim of this study was to compare the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with dantrolene and amiodarone in a pig model of cardiac arrest. VF was induced in anesthetized pigs. After 8 min of untreated VF, chest compressions and ventilation were started and one of the drugs (amiodarone 5 mg kg-1, dantrolene 2.5 mg kg-1 or saline) was applied. After 4 min of initial CPR, defibrillation was attempted. ROSC rates, hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion measurements were measured. Initial ROSC rates were 7 of 14 animals in the dantrolene group vs. 5 of 14 for amiodarone, and 3 of 10 for saline). ROSC persisted for the 120 min follow-up in 6 animals in the dantrolene group, 4 after amiodarone and 2 in the saline group (n.s.). Hemodynamics were comparable in both dantrolene group amiodarone group after obtaining ROSC. Dantrolene and amiodarone had similar outcomes in our model of prolonged cardiac arrest, However, hemodynamic stability was not significantly improved using dantrolene. Dantrolene might be an alternative drug for resuscitation and should be further investigated. ']\n",

Automated radiosynthesis of [2-(11)C-carbonyl]dantrolene, the substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), was performed for the first time through a multi-step/one-pot labeling sequence that started with ethyl 2-{2-[5-(4-nitrophenyl)furfurylidene]hydrazino}acetate and used [(11)C]phosgene as a labeling agent. After optimization of the automated synthesis conditions and parameters, [2-(11)C-carbonyl]dantrolene was obtained at a radiochemical yield of 34.0+/-8.4% (decay-corrected). The radiochemical purity was greater than 98% and the specific activity was 46.8+/-15.2GBq/micromol at the end of the synthesis. ']\n",

Mefloquine is determined in 100-microliter samples of whole blood, plasma and capillary blood collected on filter paper by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection after derivatization with phosgene. Sample preparation for whole blood and plasma involves a protein precipitation step that uses a combination of zinc and acetonitrile, followed by simultaneous extraction with methylene chloride and derivatization with phosgene at pH 9.50. Filter paper spots are immersed for 12-24 h in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, followed by simultaneous extraction with methyl tert.-butyl ether and derivatization. After evaporation of the organic phase and reconstitution with ethyl acetate, 1 microliter of the extract is injected into a megabore capillary column. Because of the high sensitivity of the method, mefloquine concentrations down to 25 nmol/l (9.5 micrograms/l) are determined in 100-microliters samples with a relative standard deviation of 12% at the 25 nmol/l level. Excellent precision was obtained over the range of concentrations tested, 0.10-3 mumol/l (45-1100 micrograms/l), in both plasma and whole blood and from filter-paper-collected capillary blood. The day-to-day relative standard deviation in plasma at the therapeutic level (1-3 mumol/l) was 4.5% (n = 8). ']\n",
