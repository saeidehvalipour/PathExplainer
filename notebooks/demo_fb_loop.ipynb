      "Association between harmful alcohol consumption behavior and dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene polymorphisms in a male Finnish population. Ethanol-induced dopamine (DA) release in the mesolimbic system may reinforce excessive alcohol intake and the progression of alcohol dependence. Within this reward system, the DA transporter (DAT1) plays a key role in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission through presynaptic DA reuptake. This study investigated whether DAT1 genetic variation was associated with either alcohol consumption behavior or alcohol dependence in a Finnish cohort. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms and a frequently studied 3'-untranslated region 40-bp variable number tandem repeat were genotyped in unrelated male Finnish participants selected from alcoholism clinical treatment facilities (n=104), or through the Finnish Population Register (n=201). All participants completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. We found significant evidence that the synonymous exon 2 rs6350 variant was positively associated with both alcohol consumption behavior (P=0.0004) and problem drinking (G allele, odds ratio: 3.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-10.78). A second single nucleotide polymorphism, rs463379 (intron 4), was negatively associated with alcohol dependence (A allele, odds ratio: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.94). However, two-locus haplotypic analysis of rs6350-rs463379 did not further increase the strength of association with the quantitative Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score trait (P=0.0024). The present findings suggest that DAT1 genetic variation influences drinking behavior in our Finnish population, where the rs6350 A and rs463379 G alleles provide a protective role against high alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence, respectively. A systematic search for DAT1 variants that affect gene function or expression in the Finnish and other populations is warranted. \n",

      "Social anxiety and drinking game behaviors among Australian university students. The relationship of social anxiety with alcohol use/problems has been examined among college student samples, but the relevance of findings to drinking game (DG) consumption/gaming consequences is not well understood due to a paucity of research. A cross-sectional sample of 224 Australian university students aged 18-25 years (Mage = 20.7 years; 63% female) was utilized for analysis. Participants completed an online questionnaire which included measures of social anxiety, DG consumption, DG consequences, and motives for playing drinking games. Social anxiety was positively associated with DG consequences, but not DG consumption. However, after controlling for DG motives, social anxiety was no longer associated with DG consequences. Rather, an indirect effect of social anxiety on DG consequences via conformity DG motives was identified. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of socially anxious students to experiencing greater drinking game consequences, but the importance of considering motives specific to playing DGs when examining these relationships. \n",

      "Thinking while drinking: Fear of negative evaluation predicts drinking behaviors of students with social anxiety. College students with social anxiety disorder experience more alcohol-related negative consequences, regardless of the amount of alcohol they consume. Social anxiety refers to psychological distress and physiological arousal in social situations due to an excessive fear of negative evaluation by others. The current study examined within-group differences in alcohol-related negative consequences of students who met or exceeded clinically-indicated social anxiety symptoms. In particular, we tested a sequential mediation model of the cognitive (i.e., fear of negative evaluation) and behavioral (protective behavioral strategies) mechanisms for the link between social anxiety disorder subtypes (i.e., interaction and performance-type) and alcohol-related negative consequences. Participants were 412 traditional-age college student drinkers who met or exceeded the clinically-indicated threshold for social anxiety disorder and completed measures of fear of negative evaluation, protective behavioral strategies (controlled consumption and serious harm reduction), and alcohol-related negative consequences. Fear of negative evaluation and serious harm reduction strategies sequentially accounted for the relationship between interaction social anxiety disorder and alcohol-related negative consequences, such that students with more severe interaction social anxiety symptoms reported more fear of negative evaluation, which was related to more serious harm reduction strategies, which predicted fewer alcohol-related negative consequences. Future directions and implications are discussed. \n",

      "Social anxiety symptoms and drinking behaviors among college students: the mediating effects of drinking motives. The impact of social anxiety on negative alcohol-related behaviors among college students has been studied extensively. Drinking motives are considered the most proximal indicator of college student drinking behavior. The current study examined the mediating role of drinking motives in the relationship that social anxiety symptoms have with problematic (alcohol consumption, harmful drinking, and negative consequences) and safe (protective behavioral strategies) drinking behaviors. Participants were 532 undergraduates who completed measures of social anxiety, drinking motives, alcohol use, harmful drinking patterns, negative consequences of alcohol use, and protective behavioral strategy use. Our results show that students with higher levels of social anxiety symptoms who were drinking for enhancement motives reported more harmful drinking and negative consequences, and used fewer protective behavioral strategies. Thus, students who were drinking to increase their positive mood were participating in more problematic drinking patterns compared with students reporting fewer social anxiety symptoms. Further, conformity motives partially mediated the relationship between social anxiety symptoms and negative consequences. Thus, students with more symptoms of social anxiety who were drinking in order to be accepted by their peers were more likely than others to experience negative consequences. Clinical and research implications are discussed. \n",

      "Bupropion induces social anxiety in adolescent mice: Influence of housing conditions. The antidepressant bupropion has received increasing attention as a pharmacological tool to treat addiction although little is known about its effects on social behaviour in adolescents. The present study aimed to evaluate if environmental housing conditions influence bupropion's actions on social behaviour of adolescent mice. Mice were either group- or individually housed for 2-weeks and then randomly divided into 2 cohorts: half of the mice remained in the initial housing condition and the other half were changed to isolated conditions for further 2-weeks. The following groups were compared: isolated/isolated (ISO/ISO), isolated/group-housed (ISO/GR), group-housed/isolated (GR/ISO), and group-housed/group-housed (GR/GR). The effects of bupropion (40, 20, 10mg/kg) or saline on social interaction were assessed for each housing condition. Social encounters were evaluated using ethological analysis. Data showed significant effects of bupropion on grooming and digging. This drug diminished time mice allocated to these behavioural categories in all housing conditions. In ISO/GR and GR/ISO conditions, bupropion increased environmental exploration (non-social exploration and exploration from a distance), reduced social investigation and increased avoidance/flee and defence/submission behaviours. An augment of avoidance/flee during social interactions was observed in bupropion-treated mice in GR/GR housing condition. These results suggest that this drug exhibits anxiogenic-like properties in social encounters between adolescent mice, especially when a transition in housing conditions has been experienced during this period. Changes in housing conditions may be a useful model for evaluating the effects of bupropion on social behaviour and the role of environmental housing conditions. \n",

      "1. **GABBR1 and Baclofen**: Baclofen is a GABA_B receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates GABA_B receptors, which are composed of subunits including GABBR1. Therefore, Baclofen directly influences the activity of GABBR1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alcohol Consumption and Social Anxiety**: The abstracts discuss various factors influencing alcohol consumption and social anxiety, including genetic polymorphisms (e.g., DAT1 gene), social anxiety, and drinking motives. These factors are indirectly related to the GABAergic system, which includes GABBR1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Dopaminergic System and Alcohol**: The first abstract highlights the role of the dopamine transporter (DAT1) in alcohol consumption behavior. The dopaminergic system interacts with the GABAergic system, and alterations in dopamine levels can influence GABA_B receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Social Anxiety and Alcohol Use**: Several abstracts discuss the relationship between social anxiety and alcohol use, noting that individuals with higher social anxiety may use alcohol to cope with social situations. Baclofen, by modulating GABA_B receptors, can have anxiolytic effects, potentially influencing alcohol consumption behaviors in socially anxious individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bupropion and Social Anxiety**: The final abstract discusses the effects of bupropion on social behavior in mice, noting its anxiogenic-like properties. While bupropion primarily affects the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, its influence on social anxiety and behavior can indirectly affect the GABAergic system, including GABBR1.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be described through the modulation of GABA_B receptors by Baclofen, which can influence alcohol consumption and social anxiety behaviors. These behaviors are also affected by genetic factors (e.g., DAT1 polymorphisms) and other pharmacological agents (e.g., bupropion), which interact with the GABAergic system. Thus, Baclofen's effects on GABBR1 can indirectly impact the broader context of alcohol use and social anxiety.\n",

We determined allele frequencies for polymorphisms at several loci of interest in neuropsychiatry-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), dopamine transporter protein (SLC6A3), D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3), apolipoprotein E (APOE), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1)-in samples of individuals from populations in several different parts of the world. Associations with psychiatric illness have been proposed for specific polymorphisms at TPH (suicide-related behaviors and impulsivity), DRD3 (schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder), SLC6A3 (susceptibility to cocaine-induced paranoia and attention-deficit disorder), CNTF (psychosis), and OPRM1 (substance dependence). APOE alleles are related to risk of Alzheimer disease. We found significant allele frequency variation among populations at all six loci. These results will provide a global framework of normal variation at these loci that might have functional significance or otherwise be related to susceptibility to various disorders or behavioral phenomena. Knowledge of this variation can be important for study design and data interpretation when individuals from various population groups are research subjects and may eventually help lead to a better understanding of behavioral adaptation. \n",

      "Naltrexone modification of drinking effects in a subacute treatment and bar-lab paradigm: influence of OPRM1 and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) genes. Naltrexone is moderately effective for the treatment of alcohol dependence, but there is great individual variability. The opioid receptor (OPRM1) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) asn40asp has been shown to alter alcohol and naltrexone response in animals and humans. In addition, the brain opioid and dopamine systems interact and might underlie drinking and craving. This study investigated the effects of the OPRM1 SNP and dopamine transporter (DAT) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genetic differences on drinking, alcohol effects, and naltrexone response under controlled conditions in nontreatment-seeking alcoholics. Two hundred and sixty-five nontreatment-seeking individuals with alcohol dependence were genotyped a priori for the OPRM1 asn40asp SNP and post hoc for DAT (SLC6A3) 9 and 10 VNTRs. Asp40 carriers (n = 43) and matched asn40 homozygotes (n = 40) were randomized to naltrexone or placebo for 7 days before receiving a priming drink and limited-access alcohol consumption in a bar-lab setting. Effects of genotypes on natural drinking as well as drinking, alcohol effects, and response to naltrexone in the bar-lab setting were examined by genotype. There were no significant main effects of naltrexone or OPRM1 genotype, or any medication by OPRM1 interaction, on drinking variables. However, in individuals who had at least one DAT 9 VNTR, and who were also OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes, naltrexone reduced drinks/d consumed under natural conditions (p = 0.006), but not in the bar-lab. OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes (p = 0.028) and DAT 9 VNTR carriers (p = 0.032) had more stimulation to alcohol after the priming drink. This study does not support a salient role for the OPRM1 asp40 alone in predicting drinking or naltrexone effects. However, although exploratory and in need of replication, it introduces the possibility that epistasis between the OPRM1 gene and DAT gene might need to be taken into account when examining differential genetic response to alcohol or medication treatment, especially in early-stage alcoholics. \n",

      "Associations among the opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) A118G polymorphism, psychiatric symptoms, and quantitative EEG in Korean males with gambling disorder: A pilot study. A single nucleotide polymorphism of A118G (SNP; rs1799971) in the opioid receptor mu-1 (OPRM1) gene is a missense variant that influences the affinity of mu-opioid receptors. This study aimed to investigate the associations among the A118G polymorphism in the OPRM1 gene, psychiatric symptoms, and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) findings in patients with gambling disorder. Fifty-five male patients with gambling disorder aged between 18 and 65 years old participated in the study. The A118G polymorphism was genotyped into the AA, GA, and GG groups by the polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Resting-state qEEG was recorded with the eyes closed, and the absolute power of the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz) frequency bands was analyzed. Psychiatric symptoms, including depression, anxiety, impulsivity and severity of gambling, were assessed by a self-rating scale. There were no significant differences in psychiatric symptoms among the three genotype groups (AA, GA, and GG). However, the frequency band power of qEEG showed significant differences among the three genotype groups. The absolute power of the beta and theta bands in the frontal lobe was higher in G allele carriers. Based on the findings of this study, the polymorphism in the OPRM1 gene might affect the neurophysiological process in patients with gambling disorder. \n",

      "Bupropion Shows Different Effects on Brain Functional Connectivity in Patients With Internet-Based Gambling Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder. Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and gambling disorder (GD) share similar clinical characteristics but show different brain functional connectivity patterns. Bupropion is known to be effective for the treatment of patients with IGD and GD. We hypothesized that bupropion may be effective for the treatment of Internet-based gambling disorder (ibGD) and IGD and that the connections between the default mode network (DMN) and cognitive control network (CCN) would be different between ibGD and IGD patients after 12 weeks of bupropion treatment. 16 patients with IGD, 15 patients with ibGD, and 15 healthy subjects were recruited in this study. At baseline and after 12 weeks of bupropion treatment, the clinical symptoms of patients with IGD or ibGD were assessed, and brain activity was evaluated using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. After the 12-week bupropion treatment, clinical symptoms, including the severity of IGD or GD, depressive symptoms, attention, and impulsivity improved in both groups. In the IGD group, the functional connectivity (FC) within the posterior DMN as well as the FC between the DMN and the CCN decreased following treatment. Moreover, the FC within the DMN in the IGD group was positively correlated with changes in Young Internet Addiction Scale scores after the bupropion treatment period. In the ibGD group, the FC within the posterior DMN decreased while the FC within the CCN increased after the bupropion treatment period. Moreover, the FC within the CCN in the ibGD group was significantly greater than that in the IGD group. Bupropion was effective in improving clinical symptoms in patients with IGD and ibGD. However, there were differences in the pharmacodynamics between the two groups. After 12 weeks of bupropion treatment, the FC within the DMN as well as between the DMN and CCN decreased in patients with IGD, whereas the FC within the CCN increased in patients with ibGD. \n",

      "Sustained-release bupropion versus naltrexone in the treatment of pathological gambling: a preliminary blind-rater study. Pathological gambling (PG) is a relatively common and highly disabling impulse control disorder. A range of psychotherapeutic agents, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and opioid antagonists, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of PG. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and opioid antagonists for PG is consistent with the observation that PG shares features of both the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders and addictive disorders. The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of sustained-release bupropion versus naltrexone in the treatment of PG. Thirty-six male pathological gamblers were enrolled in our study. A comprehensive psychiatric diagnostic evaluation was performed at baseline on all patients, and patients were screened for symptoms of gambling, depression, and anxiety using the South Oaks Gambling Screen, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale. In addition, the patients completed self-report questionnaires about their demographic status. Patients were randomized in 2 groups and received either naltrexone (n = 19) or sustained-release bupropion (n = 17) for 12 weeks in a parallel fashion. Treatment response was monitored using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale which was performed at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Patients were also assessed for the presence of gambling behavior via an unstructured interview, which was also performed at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. Raters were blind to the study treatment. The majority of patients responded well to the drug treatment. Twelve of 17 patients in the sustained-release bupropion group completed the 12-week study, and 13 of 19 naltrexone patients completed the study. Nine (75%) of the 12 completers were rated as full responders in the sustained-release bupropion group versus 10 (76%) of 12 in the naltrexone group. Three (25%) of 12 completers in the bupropion group were rated as partial responders. In the naltrexone group, 3 (23%) of 13 completers were rated as partial responders. Full response was defined as the absence of gambling for a 2-week duration together with improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale. Partial response was defined as a decrease in the frequency of gambling behavior and a decrease in the amount of money spent on gambling. This preliminary study shows that sustained-release bupropion may be effective as naltrexone in the treatment of PG. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings. \n",

      "1. **GABBR1 and Baclofen**: GABBR1 is a gene that encodes the GABA_B receptor 1, which is part of the GABA_B receptor complex involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Baclofen is a GABA_B receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates GABA_B receptors, including those encoded by GABBR1, to exert its effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Indirect Relationship**: The abstracts provided do not directly mention GABBR1 or Baclofen. However, they discuss various genetic polymorphisms and their associations with neuropsychiatric conditions and responses to different treatments, such as naltrexone and bupropion. These studies highlight the complexity of genetic influences on psychiatric disorders and treatment responses, suggesting that multiple genetic factors and their interactions can modulate the efficacy of pharmacological interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Neuropsychiatric Context**: The abstracts emphasize the role of genetic polymorphisms in neuropsychiatric disorders and treatment responses. For instance, polymorphisms in the OPRM1 gene (encoding the mu-opioid receptor) and the dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3) are shown to influence responses to naltrexone in alcohol dependence and gambling disorder. This indicates that genetic variations can significantly impact the effectiveness of treatments targeting specific neurotransmitter systems.\n",

      "4. **Implications for GABBR1 and Baclofen**: Although GABBR1 and Baclofen are not explicitly mentioned, the general principle that genetic polymorphisms can affect treatment outcomes can be extended to the GABA_B receptor system. Variations in the GABBR1 gene could potentially influence the therapeutic effects of Baclofen in treating conditions like spasticity, alcohol dependence, or other neuropsychiatric disorders where Baclofen is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Research Considerations**: The findings from the abstracts suggest that future research could explore the role of GABBR1 polymorphisms in modulating the response to Baclofen.

      "Population studies of polymorphisms at loci of neuropsychiatric interest (tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), dopamine transporter protein (SLC6A3), D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3), apolipoprotein E (APOE), mu opioid receptor (OPRM1), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)). We determined allele frequencies for polymorphisms at several loci of interest in neuropsychiatry-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), dopamine transporter protein (SLC6A3), D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3), apolipoprotein E (APOE), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1)-in samples of individuals from populations in several different parts of the world. Associations with psychiatric illness have been proposed for specific polymorphisms at TPH (suicide-related behaviors and impulsivity), DRD3 (schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder), SLC6A3 (susceptibility to cocaine-induced paranoia and attention-deficit disorder), CNTF (psychosis), and OPRM1 (substance dependence). APOE alleles are related to risk of Alzheimer disease. We found significant allele frequency variation among populations at all six loci. These results will provide a global framework of normal variation at these loci that might have functional significance or otherwise be related to susceptibility to various disorders or behavioral phenomena. Knowledge of this variation can be important for study design and data interpretation when individuals from various population groups are research subjects and may eventually help lead to a better understanding of behavioral adaptation. \n",

      "Naltrexone modification of drinking effects in a subacute treatment and bar-lab paradigm: influence of OPRM1 and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) genes. Naltrexone is moderately effective for the treatment of alcohol dependence, but there is great individual variability. The opioid receptor (OPRM1) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) asn40asp has been shown to alter alcohol and naltrexone response in animals and humans. In addition, the brain opioid and dopamine systems interact and might underlie drinking and craving. This study investigated the effects of the OPRM1 SNP and dopamine transporter (DAT) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genetic differences on drinking, alcohol effects, and naltrexone response under controlled conditions in nontreatment-seeking alcoholics. Two hundred and sixty-five nontreatment-seeking individuals with alcohol dependence were genotyped a priori for the OPRM1 asn40asp SNP and post hoc for DAT (SLC6A3) 9 and 10 VNTRs. Asp40 carriers (n = 43) and matched asn40 homozygotes (n = 40) were randomized to naltrexone or placebo for 7 days before receiving a priming drink and limited-access alcohol consumption in a bar-lab setting. Effects of genotypes on natural drinking as well as drinking, alcohol effects, and response to naltrexone in the bar-lab setting were examined by genotype. There were no significant main effects of naltrexone or OPRM1 genotype, or any medication by OPRM1 interaction, on drinking variables. However, in individuals who had at least one DAT 9 VNTR, and who were also OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes, naltrexone reduced drinks/d consumed under natural conditions (p = 0.006), but not in the bar-lab. OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes (p = 0.028) and DAT 9 VNTR carriers (p = 0.032) had more stimulation to alcohol after the priming drink. This study does not support a salient role for the OPRM1 asp40 alone in predicting drinking or naltrexone effects. However, although exploratory and in need of replication, it introduces the possibility that epistasis between the OPRM1 gene and DAT gene might need to be taken into account when examining differential genetic response to alcohol or medication treatment, especially in early-stage alcoholics. \n",

      "Stress-induced and cue-induced craving for alcohol in heavy drinkers: Preliminary evidence of genetic moderation by the OPRM1 and CRH-BP genes. Neurobiological theories of addiction have highlighted disruption in stress pathways as a central feature of addictive disorders, and pharmacological treatments targeting stress mechanisms hold great promise. This study examines genetic determinants of stress-induced and cue-induced craving in heavy drinkers by testing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the corticotrophin-releasing hormone binding protein (CRH-BP) gene and the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene. This study combines guided imagery stress exposure and in vivo alcohol cue exposure in a sample of 64 (23 women) non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers. Analyses, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, revealed that a tag SNP of the CRH-BP gene (rs10055255) moderated stress-induced craving in this sample. The same SNP predicted greater affective responses to the stress manipulation, including greater levels of subjective tension and negative mood. The Asp40 allele of the OPRM1 was associated with greater cue-induced alcohol craving following the neutral imagery condition. These initial results extend recent preclinical and clinical findings implicating the CRH-BP in stress-related alcoholism and confirm the role of the Asp40 allele of the OPRM1 gene in reward-driven alcohol phenotypes. Human laboratory models of stress and cue-induced craving may be useful in pharmacotherapy development targeting dysregulation of stress systems. Larger studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings, which should also be extended to clinical samples. \n",

The mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) codes for the mu-opioid receptor, which binds beta-endorphin. The A118G polymorphism in this gene affects beta-endorphin binding such that the Asp40 variant (G allele) binds beta-endorphin 3 times more tightly than the more common Asn40 variant (A allele). This study investigated the influence of the A118G polymorphism on cue reactivity after exposure to an alcoholic beverage in male heavy drinkers. Participants were either homozygous for the A allele (n=84) or carrying at least 1 copy of the G allele (n=24). All participants took part in a cue-reactivity paradigm where they were exposed to water and beer in 3-minute trials. The dependent variables of main interest were subjective craving for alcohol, subjective arousal, and saliva production. G allele carriers reported significantly more craving for alcohol than the A allele participants (as indicated by the within-subject difference in craving after beer vs after water exposure). No differences were found for subjective arousal and saliva. Both groups did not differ in family history of alcoholism. Participants with the G allele reported a significantly higher lifetime prevalence of drug use than participants homozygous for the A allele. A stronger urge to drink alcohol after exposure to an alcoholic beverage might contribute to a heightened risk for developing alcohol-related problems in individuals with a copy of the G allele. The G allele might also predispose to drug use in general. \n",

      "Naltrexone selectively elevates GABAergic neuroactive steroid levels in heavy drinkers with the Asp40 allele of the OPRM1 gene: a pilot investigation. Preclinical studies have implicated GABAergic neurosteroids in behavioral responses to alcohol. Naltrexone is thought to blunt the reinforcing effects of alcohol, and a few studies have found that the effects of naltrexone are moderated by the Asn40Asp polymorphisms of the OPRM1 gene. The present study seeks to integrate these lines of research by testing (i) the moderating role of the functional Asn40Asp polymorphism of the OPRM1 gene on naltrexone-induced alternations in GABAergic neurosteroid levels, namely (3alpha,5alpha)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone, ALLO); and (ii) the combined effects of naltrexone or genotype with alcohol administration on neurosteroid levels in a sample of at-risk drinkers. Participants were 32 (9 females) nontreatment-seeking heavy drinkers who completed a placebo-controlled laboratory study of naltrexone (50 mg/d for 3 days) and provided complete sets of serum samples for ALLO assays before and after alcohol administration under both naltrexone and placebo conditions. Naltrexone treatment raised ALLO levels among carriers of the Asp40 allele, but not homozygotes for the Asn40 allele. The Asn40Asp polymorphism did not moderate effects of naltrexone on cortisol levels. Ethanol infusion modestly reduced ALLO levels in all subjects, independent of genotype or naltrexone exposure. Naltrexone increased ALLO levels among individuals with the Asn40Asp allele suggesting a potential neurosteroid contribution to the neuropharmacological effects of naltrexone among Asp40 carriers. \n",

      "Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be described through the involvement of the OPRM1 gene and its polymorphisms, which influence the response to alcohol and medications like naltrexone. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **OPRM1 Gene and Alcohol Response**: Several studies highlight the role of the OPRM1 gene, particularly the Asn40Asp polymorphism, in modulating the effects of alcohol and the response to treatments like naltrexone. For instance, individuals with the Asp40 allele show different craving responses and neurosteroid levels when exposed to alcohol or naltrexone.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Naltrexone and GABAergic Neurosteroids**: One study specifically mentions that naltrexone increases levels of the GABAergic neurosteroid allopregnanolone (ALLO) in individuals with the Asp40 allele of the OPRM1 gene. This suggests a link between the opioid system and GABAergic modulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **GABAergic System and Baclofen**: Baclofen is a GABA_B receptor agonist, which means it directly influences the GABAergic system. Although Baclofen is not directly mentioned in the abstracts, its role as a GABA_B receptor agonist connects it to the GABAergic system discussed in the context of naltrexone and ALLO levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Indirect Relationship via Neurosteroids**: The increase in GABAergic neurosteroids (like ALLO) due to naltrexone in individuals with certain OPRM1 polymorphisms suggests that the GABAergic system is modulated by opioid receptor activity. Since Baclofen acts on the GABA_B receptors, it indirectly relates to the modulation of the GABAergic system influenced by opioid receptor activity and neurosteroid levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **GABBR1 and Baclofen**: GABBR1 is one of the subunits of the GABA_B receptor, which Baclofen targets. Therefore, any modulation of the GABAergic system through opioid receptor activity and neurosteroids indirectly involves GABBR1, as it is part of the receptor complex that Baclofen activates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be described through the modulation of the GABAergic system by opioid receptor activity (specifically OPRM1 polymorphisms) and the resulting changes in neurosteroid levels, which Baclofen, as a GABA_B receptor agonist, would influence.\n",

      "Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. \n",

      "Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. \n",

      "Analysis of dopamine transporter gene expression pattern -- generation of DAT-iCre transgenic mice. The dopamine transporter is an essential component of the dopaminergic synapse. It is located in the presynaptic neurons and regulates extracellular dopamine levels. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the dopamine transporter gene, for investigations of gene function in dopaminergic neurons. The codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. The pattern of expression of the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene was similar to that of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene, as shown by immunohistochemistry. Recombinase activity was further studied in mice carrying both the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene and a construct expressing the beta-galactosidase gene after Cre-mediated recombination. In situ studies showed that beta-galactosidase (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl beta-D-galactoside staining) and the dopamine transporter (immunofluorescence) had identical distributions in the ventral midbrain. We used this animal model to study the distribution of dopamine transporter gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei in detail. The expression profile of tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis) was broader than that of beta-galactosidase in A12 to A15. Thus, only a fraction of neurons synthesizing dopamine expressed the dopamine transporter gene. The bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgenic line is a unique tool for targeting Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination to dopamine neurons for studies of gene function or for labeling living cells, following the crossing of these mice with transgenic Cre reporter lines producing fluorescent proteins. \n",

      "Focus on Human Monoamine Transporter Selectivity. New Human DAT and NET Models, Experimental Validation, and SERT Affinity Exploration. The most commonly used antidepressant drugs are the serotonin transporter inhibitors. Their effects depend strongly on the selectivity for a single monoamine transporter compared to other amine transporters or receptors, and the selectivity is roughly influenced by the spatial protein structure. Here, we provide a computational study on three human monoamine transporters, i.e., DAT, NET, and SERT. Starting from the construction of hDAT and hNET models, whose three-dimensional structure is unknown, and the prediction of the binding pose for 19 known inhibitors, 3D-QSAR models of three human transporters were built. The training set variability, which was high in structure and activity profile, was validated using a set of in-house compounds. Results concern more than one aspect. First of all, hDAT and hNET three-dimensional structures were built, validated, and compared to the hSERT one; second, the computational study highlighted the differences in binding site arrangement statistically correlated to inhibitor selectivity; third, the profiling of new inhibitors pointed out a conservation of the inhibitory activity trend between rabbit and human SERT with a difference of about 1 order of magnitude; fourth, binding and functional studies confirmed 4-(benzyloxy)-4-phenylpiperidine 20a-d and 21a-d as potent SERT inhibitors. In particular, one of the compounds (compound 20b) revealed a higher affinity for SERT than paroxetine in human platelets. \n",

      "Gain of function mutants reveal sites important for the interaction of the atypical inhibitors benztropine and bupropion with monoamine transporters. Two atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter, benztropine, used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and bupropion, used as an antidepressant, show very different psychostimulant effects when compared with another inhibitor, cocaine. Taking advantage of the differential sensitivity of the dopamine and the norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET) to benztropine and bupropion, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to produce gain-of-function mutants in NET which demonstrate that Ala279 in the trans-membrane domain 5 (TM5) and Ser359 in the TM7 of DAT are responsible for the higher sensitivity of DAT to both bupropion and benztropine. Substitution of these two DAT residues into the NET background does not alter the potency of NET-selective inhibitors, such as desipramine. The results from experiments examining the ability of DAT-selective inhibitors to displace [3H]nisoxetine binding in NET gain-of-function mutants suggest that Ser359 contributes to the initial binding of the inhibitor, and that Ala279 may influence subsequent steps involved in the blockade of translocation. Thus, these studies begin to identify residues that are important for the unique molecular interactions of benztropine and bupropion with the DAT, and that ultimately may contribute to the distinct behavioral actions of these drugs. \n",

      "Enantioselective effects of hydroxy metabolites of bupropion on behavior and on function of monoamine transporters and nicotinic receptors. Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that also has usefulness as a smoking-cessation aid. Because hydroxybupropion, a major metabolite of bupropion, is believed to contribute to its antidepressant activity, this metabolite may also contribute to the smoking-cessation properties of bupropion. This study investigated the effects of hydrobupropion enantiomers on monoamine transporters and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes. Racemic bupropion and hydroxybupropion inhibit [(3)H]norepinephrine (NE) uptake with similar potency (IC(50) values of 1.9 and 1.7 microM, respectively), but most of the latter activity resides in the (2S,3S)-hydroxy isomer (IC(50) = 520 nM) rather than (2S,3R)-hydroxybupropion (IC(50) > 10,000 nM). Similar results were found with [(3)H]dopamine (DA) uptake. The effects of bupropion and enantiomers of hydroxybupropion on human nAChR subtypes indicate that the (2S,3S) isomer is more potent than the (2S,3R) isomer or racemic bupropion as an antagonist of alpha(4)beta(2) (functional IC(50) = 3.3 microM). In addition, (2S,3S)-hyroxybupropion and bupropion were considerably more potent than (2R, -3R)-hydroxybupropion in a mouse depression model (forced swimming test) and in antagonism of acute nicotine effects in mice. Together, our results suggest that clinical and behavioral effects of bupropion arise from actions at nAChR as well as DA and NE transporters. Furthermore, our data suggest that the (2S,3S)-hydroxybupropion isomer may be a better drug candidate for smoking cessation than bupropion because of its higher potency at the relevant targets. \n",

      "Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. \n",

      "Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. \n",

      "Analysis of dopamine transporter gene expression pattern -- generation of DAT-iCre transgenic mice. The dopamine transporter is an essential component of the dopaminergic synapse. It is located in the presynaptic neurons and regulates extracellular dopamine levels. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the dopamine transporter gene, for investigations of gene function in dopaminergic neurons. The codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. The pattern of expression of the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene was similar to that of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene, as shown by immunohistochemistry. Recombinase activity was further studied in mice carrying both the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene and a construct expressing the beta-galactosidase gene after Cre-mediated recombination. In situ studies showed that beta-galactosidase (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl beta-D-galactoside staining) and the dopamine transporter (immunofluorescence) had identical distributions in the ventral midbrain. We used this animal model to study the distribution of dopamine transporter gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei in detail. The expression profile of tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis) was broader than that of beta-galactosidase in A12 to A15. Thus, only a fraction of neurons synthesizing dopamine expressed the dopamine transporter gene. The bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgenic line is a unique tool for targeting Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination to dopamine neurons for studies of gene function or for labeling living cells, following the crossing of these mice with transgenic Cre reporter lines producing fluorescent proteins. \n",

      "Use of bupropion in patients who exhibit orthostatic hypotension on tricyclic antidepressants. Patients who developed clinically significant and documented orthostatic hypotension during treatment with tricyclic antidepressants were withdrawn from the tricyclic for at least 5 days. During a baseline period of 3-7 days a placebo identical to bupropion was then administered. A baseline electrocardiogram, psychiatric scale ratings, vital signs, clinical laboratory and physical exam were performed on those patients on placebo who were free of orthostatic hypotension for 3 consecutive days. Patients were then transferred to an ascending dosage regimen of bupropion. Only patients who were treated with bupropion for at least 7 days and who received a daily dose of at least 450 mg were considered to have completed the study. The results in 12 inpatients in 2 centers showed that bupropion produced no clinically significant alterations in pulse rate, systolic blood pressure or orthostasis as compared to placebo in patients who had clinically significant orthostatic hypotension caused by tricyclic treatment. \n",

', 'Use of bupropion in patients who exhibit orthostatic hypotension on tricyclic antidepressants. Patients who developed clinically significant and documented orthostatic hypotension during treatment with tricyclic antidepressants were withdrawn from the tricyclic for at least 5 days. During a baseline period of 3-7 days a placebo identical to bupropion was then administered. A baseline electrocardiogram, psychiatric scale ratings, vital signs, clinical laboratory and physical exam were performed on those patients on placebo who were free of orthostatic hypotension for 3 consecutive days. Patients were then transferred to an ascending dosage regimen of bupropion. Only patients who were treated with bupropion for at least 7 days and who received a daily dose of at least 450 mg were considered to have completed the study. The results in 12 inpatients in 2 centers showed that bupropion produced no clinically significant alterations in pulse rate, systolic blood pressure or orthostasis as compared to placebo in patients who had clinically significant orthostatic hypotension caused by tricyclic treatment. ', 'Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. ', '', 'Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. ', \"Association study of the SLC6A3 VNTR (DAT) and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A polymorphisms with alcohol dependence in a population from northeastern Brazil. Alcohol dependence (AD) is a complex psychiatric disorder, affecting 5.4% of the general population lifetime, characterized by excessive alcohol consumption influenced by environmental risk factors and genetic factors. Genetic alterations in dopaminergic system are involved in the treatment and etiology of AD. The aim of this search was to test the association of the SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a transporter and receptor of the dopaminergic system, with AD through a study in a population of northeastern Brazil. The study design was a case-control that included 227 males of northeastern Brazil (113 alcoholics and 114 controls). Alcoholics were classified according to the DSM-IV criteria for AD and controls were subjects who had nonalcohol problems or who never drank. Genotyping was detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR and RFLP-PCR for DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A, and subsequent electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies and association of polymorphisms with AD were assessed by chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and odds ratio (OR) with a confidence interval of 95% and significance p < 0.05. Data were analyzed on BioEstat 5.3 software. The SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR was associated with AD, allelic, and genotypic frequencies were significantly different, respectively (A9 vs. A10: OR = 1.88; p = 0.01; A9/A9 vs. A10/A10: OR = 6.25; p = 0.02; A9/A9 vs. A9/A10 + A10A10: OR = 5.44; p = 0.03). However, there was no statistically significant difference when the allelic (p = 0.10) and genotypic (p > 0.05) frequencies for DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A were compared. These findings suggest that A9 allele and A9/A9 genotype of the SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR are involved in the vulnerability to AD in the population studied. However, for the DRD2/ANKK1 SNP does not present contributions to the development of AD. \"]\n",

      "Association between harmful alcohol consumption behavior and dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene polymorphisms in a male Finnish population. Ethanol-induced dopamine (DA) release in the mesolimbic system may reinforce excessive alcohol intake and the progression of alcohol dependence. Within this reward system, the DA transporter (DAT1) plays a key role in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission through presynaptic DA reuptake. This study investigated whether DAT1 genetic variation was associated with either alcohol consumption behavior or alcohol dependence in a Finnish cohort. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms and a frequently studied 3'-untranslated region 40-bp variable number tandem repeat were genotyped in unrelated male Finnish participants selected from alcoholism clinical treatment facilities (n=104), or through the Finnish Population Register (n=201). All participants completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. We found significant evidence that the synonymous exon 2 rs6350 variant was positively associated with both alcohol consumption behavior (P=0.0004) and problem drinking (G allele, odds ratio: 3.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-10.78). A second single nucleotide polymorphism, rs463379 (intron 4), was negatively associated with alcohol dependence (A allele, odds ratio: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.94). However, two-locus haplotypic analysis of rs6350-rs463379 did not further increase the strength of association with the quantitative Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score trait (P=0.0024). The present findings suggest that DAT1 genetic variation influences drinking behavior in our Finnish population, where the rs6350 A and rs463379 G alleles provide a protective role against high alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence, respectively. A systematic search for DAT1 variants that affect gene function or expression in the Finnish and other populations is warranted. \n",

      "I. Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study of polyenylphosphatidylcholine in alcoholic liver disease: effects on drinking behavior by nurse/physician teams. This multicenter prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of polyenylphosphatidylcholine against the progression of liver fibrosis toward cirrhosis in alcoholics. Seven hundred eighty-nine alcoholics with an average intake of 16 drinks per day were enrolled. To control excessive drinking, patients were referred to a standard 12-step-based alcoholism treatment program, but most patients refused to attend. Accordingly, study follow-up procedures incorporated the essential features of the brief-intervention approach. An overall substantial and sustained reduction in drinking was observed. Hepatic histological and other findings are described in a companion article. Patients were randomized to receive daily three tablets of either polyenylphosphatidylcholine or placebo. Monthly follow-up visits included an extensive session with a medical nurse along with brief visits with a study physician (hepatologist or gastroenterologist). A detailed physical examination occurred every 6 months. In addition, telephone consultations with the nurse were readily available. All patients had a liver biopsy before entry; a repeat biopsy was scheduled at 24 and 48 months. There was a striking decrease in average daily alcohol intake to approximately 2.5 drinks per day. This was sustained over the course of the trial, lasting from 2 to 6 years. The effect was similar both in early dropouts and long-term patients, i.e., those with a 24-month biopsy or beyond. In a treatment trial of alcoholic liver fibrosis, a striking reduction in alcohol consumption from 16 to 2.5 daily drinks was achieved with a brief-intervention approach, which consisted of a relative economy of therapeutic efforts that relied mainly on treatment sessions with a medical nurse accompanied by shorter reinforcing visits with a physician. This approach deserves generalization to address the heavy drinking problems commonly encountered in primary care and medical specialty practices. \n",

      "Effect of ALDH2 and CYP2E1 gene polymorphisms on drinking behavior and alcoholic liver disease in Japanese male workers. We examined the relationships of ALDH2 and CYP2E1 genotypes on drinking behavior and the incidence of alcoholic liver disease in Japanese male workers. Two hundred and eighty-seven Japanese men were selected from one metal company to adjust for similar economic and social backgrounds. Drinking behavior was assessed from a self-assessment questionnaire. Genotypes of ALDH2 and CYP2E1 were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and with the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, respectively. The frequency of the ALDH2 genotype was 55% for typical homozygotes, 42% for heterozygotes, and 4% for atypical homozygotes. The frequency of the CYP2E1 genotype was 62% for c1 homozygotes, 35% for heterozygotes, and 3% for c2 homozygotes. The ALDH2 genotype closely influenced drinking habits, but not the CYP2E1 genotype. Among habitual drinkers, ALDH2 typical homozygotes consumed significantly larger amounts of ethanol than ALDH2 heterozygotes, whereas CYP2E1 genotypes did not influence daily alcohol consumption. Sixteen men (5.6%) were diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease. In terms of ALDH2 genotypes, 12 cases (7.6%) were typical homozygotes and 4 (3.4%) were heterozygotes, whereas the incidence of alcoholic liver disease was not different between c1/c1 homozygotes and c1/c2 heterozygotes. When the interactive contribution of the ALDH2 and CYP2E1 genotypes on drinking behavior and the incidence of alcoholic liver disease were examined, there were no significant differences in the CYP2E1 genotype among the subjects with the same ALDH2 genotype. The ALDH2 genotype is strongly associated with individual alcohol drinking behavior and the development of alcoholic liver disease in Japanese male workers, but the CYP2E1 genotype is not. \n",

      "Polymorphism of alcohol-metabolizing genes affects drinking behavior and alcoholic liver disease in Japanese men. Alcohol is known to be mainly metabolized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), and cytochrome P-450IIEI. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of polymorphism of these ethanol-metabolizing enzymes in drinking behavior and the progression of alcoholic liver disease among Japanese men. Polymorphism of the ADH2, ALDH2, and P-45IIEI genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis in 189 normal Japanese men and 26 male patients with alcoholic liver disease. Drinking behavior was estimated by self-assessment according to DSM-III-R criteria. Facial flushing was reported in 91 subjects heterozygous for ALDH2*1/*2 and in two subjects homozygous for ALDH2*2/*2, but was not found in 96 subjects homozygous for ALDH2*1/*1. In contrast, polymorphism of ADH2 and P-450IIEI did not differ between flushers and nonflushers. Although the flushers only drank a small amount of alcohol (< 20 g of ethanol/day), the nonflushers were divided into a group of moderate drinkers (20 to 80 g/day; n = 54) and a group of heavy drinkers (> 80 g/day; n = 42). A high preponderance of heterozygosity for the ADH2*1/*2 genes (20/42; 60%) and a high frequency of the ADH2*1 allele were found in heavy drinkers, compared with moderate drinkers. However, cytochrome P-45IIEI gene polymorphism was similar among the moderate and heavy drinkers. Not only a high frequency of the ALDH2*1 and ADH2*1 alleles, but also a high frequency of the P-450IIEI c2 allele was found in the patients with alcoholic liver disease. From these results, the drinking behavior of Japanese men is strongly influenced by the ALDH2*1 allele, and the level of alcohol intake is affected by the ADH2*1 allele, but not by cytochrome P-45IIEI. However, progression to alcoholic liver disease among heavy drinkers may be affected by the cytochrome P-450IIEI c2 allele. \n",

      "Disposition of bupropion in healthy volunteers and subjects with alcoholic liver disease. Bupropion hydrochloride is a new monocyclic antidepressant. In humans, its disposition results in the formation of three major metabolites: the morpholinol metabolite, the erythroamino alcohol, and the threoamino alcohol metabolite. Bupropion's disposition was monitored following a single oral 200 mg dose in eight healthy volunteers and eight age- (44.5 +/- 8.4 years) and weight- (77.4 +/- 6.7 kg) matched volunteers with alcoholic liver disease. This latter group is of interest because the incidence of depression is more frequent in alcoholics than in the general population, and the liver is the major route of elimination for cyclic antidepressants. The mean elimination half-life of the morpholinol metabolite was significantly prolonged in subjects with alcoholic liver disease (32.2 +/- 13.5 vs. 21.1 +/- 4.9 hours (p less than 0.05), while the differences in bupropion (17.3 +/- 8.6 hours vs. 16.5 +/- 10.4 hours for healthy subjects and subjects with alcoholic liver disease, respectively), erythroamino alcohol (26.1 +/- 13.3 hours vs. 29.8 +/- 6.9 hours for healthy subjects and subjects with alcoholic liver disease, respectively), and threoamino alcohol (25.5 +/- 8.6 hours vs. 23.4 +/- 10.7 hours for healthy subjects and subjects with alcoholic liver disease, respectively) were minimal. Mean area under the plasma concentration time curves for bupropion and metabolites were increased in subjects with alcoholic liver disease; however, clear differences between means of these small groups did not emerge, probably due to the increased variability of bupropion pharmacokinetics in these subjects. As a therapeutic agent for the treatment of depression in chronic alcoholics who may consume alcohol in combination with their antidepressant therapy, the lack of sedation with bupropion could be advantageous.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \n",

      "Given the context provided by the scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between GABBR1 (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type B Receptor Subunit 1) and Baclofen can be described as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GABBR1 and Alcohol Consumption**: The abstracts discuss various genetic factors influencing alcohol consumption and dependence, such as polymorphisms in the DAT1, ALDH2, and CYP2E1 genes. While GABBR1 is not directly mentioned, it is known from other literature that GABBR1 is involved in the GABAergic system, which plays a significant role in modulating neurotransmission and has been implicated in alcohol dependence and consumption behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Baclofen and Alcohol Dependence**: Baclofen is a GABA_B receptor agonist, which means it activates GABA_B receptors, including those formed by GABBR1 subunits. Baclofen has been studied for its potential to reduce alcohol craving and consumption in individuals with alcohol dependence. The mechanism by which Baclofen exerts its effects is through the modulation of the GABAergic system, which can influence dopamine release and other neurotransmitter systems involved in addiction and reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be inferred through their roles in the GABAergic system. GABBR1 is a component of the GABA_B receptor, and Baclofen acts on this receptor to produce its therapeutic effects. Therefore, while the abstracts do not directly link GABBR1 and Baclofen, understanding their roles in the GABAergic system and their influence on alcohol-related behaviors provides a basis for their indirect relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, GABBR1 is part of the receptor complex that Baclofen targets to exert its effects on reducing alcohol consumption and dependence. This indirect relationship is rooted in their shared involvement in the GABAergic system, which is crucial for modulating behaviors associated with alcohol use.\n",

      "Population studies of polymorphisms at loci of neuropsychiatric interest (tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), dopamine transporter protein (SLC6A3), D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3), apolipoprotein E (APOE), mu opioid receptor (OPRM1), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)). We determined allele frequencies for polymorphisms at several loci of interest in neuropsychiatry-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), dopamine transporter protein (SLC6A3), D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3), apolipoprotein E (APOE), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1)-in samples of individuals from populations in several different parts of the world. Associations with psychiatric illness have been proposed for specific polymorphisms at TPH (suicide-related behaviors and impulsivity), DRD3 (schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder), SLC6A3 (susceptibility to cocaine-induced paranoia and attention-deficit disorder), CNTF (psychosis), and OPRM1 (substance dependence). APOE alleles are related to risk of Alzheimer disease. We found significant allele frequency variation among populations at all six loci. These results will provide a global framework of normal variation at these loci that might have functional significance or otherwise be related to susceptibility to various disorders or behavioral phenomena. Knowledge of this variation can be important for study design and data interpretation when individuals from various population groups are research subjects and may eventually help lead to a better understanding of behavioral adaptation. \n",

      "Naltrexone modification of drinking effects in a subacute treatment and bar-lab paradigm: influence of OPRM1 and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) genes. Naltrexone is moderately effective for the treatment of alcohol dependence, but there is great individual variability. The opioid receptor (OPRM1) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) asn40asp has been shown to alter alcohol and naltrexone response in animals and humans. In addition, the brain opioid and dopamine systems interact and might underlie drinking and craving. This study investigated the effects of the OPRM1 SNP and dopamine transporter (DAT) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genetic differences on drinking, alcohol effects, and naltrexone response under controlled conditions in nontreatment-seeking alcoholics. Two hundred and sixty-five nontreatment-seeking individuals with alcohol dependence were genotyped a priori for the OPRM1 asn40asp SNP and post hoc for DAT (SLC6A3) 9 and 10 VNTRs. Asp40 carriers (n = 43) and matched asn40 homozygotes (n = 40) were randomized to naltrexone or placebo for 7 days before receiving a priming drink and limited-access alcohol consumption in a bar-lab setting. Effects of genotypes on natural drinking as well as drinking, alcohol effects, and response to naltrexone in the bar-lab setting were examined by genotype. There were no significant main effects of naltrexone or OPRM1 genotype, or any medication by OPRM1 interaction, on drinking variables. However, in individuals who had at least one DAT 9 VNTR, and who were also OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes, naltrexone reduced drinks/d consumed under natural conditions (p = 0.006), but not in the bar-lab. OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes (p = 0.028) and DAT 9 VNTR carriers (p = 0.032) had more stimulation to alcohol after the priming drink. This study does not support a salient role for the OPRM1 asp40 alone in predicting drinking or naltrexone effects. However, although exploratory and in need of replication, it introduces the possibility that epistasis between the OPRM1 gene and DAT gene might need to be taken into account when examining differential genetic response to alcohol or medication treatment, especially in early-stage alcoholics. \n",

      "Association Between the A118G Polymorphism of the OPRM1 Gene and Suicidal Depression in a Large Cohort of Outpatients with Depression. Growing evidences suggest that depression with suicidal ideation (SI) could be a specific phenotype with its own characteristics. Moreover, opioid system deregulation might be implicated in suicidal behaviour (SB). The aim of this study was to determine whether the A118G polymorphism (rs1799971) in ORPM1 (the gene encoding opioid receptor mu 1) is associated with suicidal depression (ie, moderate to severe depression with SI) in a large cohort of outpatients with depression. GENESE is a large, prospective, naturalistic cohort of French adult outpatients with depression (DSM-IV criteria), treated and followed for 6 weeks. Depression severity was assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and SI with the suicidal item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI). From this cohort, patients with moderate or severe depression (HADS-D subscale score >11) were selected and classified as without SI (MADRS-SI < 2), or with SI (MADRS-SI >= 2). The AA/AG genotypes of the A118G polymorphism were significantly associated with suicidal depression in the non-adjusted (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = [1.28; 4.18]; p-value = 0.005) and in the adjusted models (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = [1.35; 4.78]; p-value = 0.004). Outpatients with depression harbouring the A allele are at higher risk of SI (and possibly SB) than those carrying the G allele. More studies are needed to better understand the link between this polymorphism and SB. \n",

      "SSRI versus bupropion effects on symptom clusters in suicidal depression: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial. Identifying the depression symptoms most closely associated with suicidal thoughts and which medications provide the fastest depression relief may help suicide prevention. Post hoc analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind, 8-week clinical trial of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine controlled release (n = 36) versus the norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion extended release (n = 38) was conducted in patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder and past suicide attempt or current suicidal thoughts. Treatment effects on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory symptom clusters were compared. We hypothesized that paroxetine would demonstrate a superior effect on nonsuicidal, affective/cognitive depression symptom clusters that our prior work found to be associated with suicidal thoughts and attempts. Data were collected from February 2005 to January 2010. There was a treatment main effect on HDRS psychic depression (depressed mood, guilt, retardation, helpless, hopeless, worthless) (estimate = -2.2; 95% CI, -3.2 to -1.1; t67.16 = -4.01; P < .001), one of the clusters most strongly correlated to suicidal ideation. The net drug effect demonstrated that mean psychic depression score was 2.2 points lower after 1 week of paroxetine compared to bupropion treatment. The significance level of this effect was P < .001 at weeks 1 and 2, P = .012 at week 3 and P = .051 at week 4. Results for other depression scale factors were nonsignificant (P > .05). The results require replication but suggest a pathway by which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment may exert a stronger effect compared with norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor treatment on reduction of suicidal thoughts during initial weeks of pharmacotherapy in these higher risk patients.

      "GABBR1 is a gene that encodes the GABA_B receptor 1, which is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Baclofen is a medication that acts as a GABA_B receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates these receptors. While the abstracts do not directly discuss GABBR1 or Baclofen, they provide a broader context of how genetic variations in neurotransmitter systems can influence susceptibility to psychiatric disorders and responses to medications.\n",

      "1. **Genetic Variations and Psychiatric Disorders**: The abstracts highlight the importance of genetic polymorphisms in various neurotransmitter systems (e.g., dopamine, opioid) and their associations with psychiatric conditions such as depression, substance dependence, and suicidal behavior. Although GABBR1 is not explicitly mentioned, it is part of the broader landscape of neurotransmitter systems that can be influenced by genetic variations.\n",

      "3. **Neurotransmitter Interactions**: The abstracts mention interactions between different neurotransmitter systems, such as the opioid and dopamine systems. The GABAergic system, which includes GABBR1, also interacts with other neurotransmitter systems.

      "SLC6A3 (DAT1) as a Novel Candidate Biomarker Gene for Suicidal Behavior. It has been previously shown that the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter systems might influence the predisposition to suicidal behavior. This study aims to estimate the contribution of 11 polymorphisms in the genes SLC6A4 (5HTT), HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR1B, SLC6A3 (DAT1), DRD4, DRD2, COMT, and BDNF to suicidal behavior and severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety in the Russian population. The study was performed on 100 patients with repeated suicide attempts and 154 controls. We first found an association between SLC6A3 (DAT1) 40 bp VNTR locus and suicidal behavior. This association was significant; when using the codominant (p = 0.006), dominant (p = 0.001), overdominant (p = 0.004), and log-additive (p = 0.004) models, LL genotype played a protective role (OR = 0.48, 0.29-0.82, p = 0.005). Difference in the distribution of COMT rs4680 genotypes was significant in the codominant (p = 0.04), dominant (p = 0.013), and log-additive (p = 0.02) models, and AA genotype might protect against suicide (OR = 0.49, 0.26-0.91, p = 0.025). SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR + rs25531 locus was significant in the recessive model (p = 0.024), and also affected the severity of symptoms of depression (p = 0.044) and personal anxiety (p = 0.029). Our results suggest that allelic variants of SLC6A3, COMT, and SLC6A4 genes might be considered as risk factors for suicidal attempts. \n",

      "Pilot randomized clinical trial of an SSRI vs bupropion: effects on suicidal behavior, ideation, and mood in major depression. Randomized controlled trials in depressed patients selected for elevated suicidal risk are rare. The resultant lack of data leaves uncertainty about treatment in this population. This study compared a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with a noradrenergic/dopaminergic antidepressant in major depression with elevated suicidal risk factors. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, clinical pilot trial of paroxetine (N=36) or bupropion (N=38) in DSM IV major depression with a suicide attempt history or current suicidal ideation. The effects during acute (8 weeks) and continuation treatment (up to 16 weeks) were measured. Main outcomes were suicidal behavior and ideation. The secondary outcome was modified 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score subtracting the suicide item (mHDRS-17). Treatment was not associated with time to a suicidal event and no treatment main effect or treatment * time interaction on suicidal ideation or mHDRS-17 was found. Exploratory model selection showed modest advantages for paroxetine on: (1) mHDRS-17 (p=0.02); and (2) in a separate model adjusted for baseline depression, for suicidal ideation measured with the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (p=0.03), with benefit increasing with baseline severity. Depressed patients with greater baseline suicidal ideation treated with paroxetine compared with bupropion appeared to experience greater acute improvement in suicidal ideation, after adjusting for global depression. Given the lack of evidence-based pharmacotherapy guidelines for suicidal, depressed patients-an important public health population-this preliminary finding merits further study. \n",

We determined allele frequencies for polymorphisms at several loci of interest in neuropsychiatry-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), dopamine transporter protein (SLC6A3), D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3), apolipoprotein E (APOE), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1)-in samples of individuals from populations in several different parts of the world. Associations with psychiatric illness have been proposed for specific polymorphisms at TPH (suicide-related behaviors and impulsivity), DRD3 (schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder), SLC6A3 (susceptibility to cocaine-induced paranoia and attention-deficit disorder), CNTF (psychosis), and OPRM1 (substance dependence). APOE alleles are related to risk of Alzheimer disease. We found significant allele frequency variation among populations at all six loci. These results will provide a global framework of normal variation at these loci that might have functional significance or otherwise be related to susceptibility to various disorders or behavioral phenomena. Knowledge of this variation can be important for study design and data interpretation when individuals from various population groups are research subjects and may eventually help lead to a better understanding of behavioral adaptation. \n",

      "Naltrexone modification of drinking effects in a subacute treatment and bar-lab paradigm: influence of OPRM1 and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) genes. Naltrexone is moderately effective for the treatment of alcohol dependence, but there is great individual variability. The opioid receptor (OPRM1) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) asn40asp has been shown to alter alcohol and naltrexone response in animals and humans. In addition, the brain opioid and dopamine systems interact and might underlie drinking and craving. This study investigated the effects of the OPRM1 SNP and dopamine transporter (DAT) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genetic differences on drinking, alcohol effects, and naltrexone response under controlled conditions in nontreatment-seeking alcoholics. Two hundred and sixty-five nontreatment-seeking individuals with alcohol dependence were genotyped a priori for the OPRM1 asn40asp SNP and post hoc for DAT (SLC6A3) 9 and 10 VNTRs. Asp40 carriers (n = 43) and matched asn40 homozygotes (n = 40) were randomized to naltrexone or placebo for 7 days before receiving a priming drink and limited-access alcohol consumption in a bar-lab setting. Effects of genotypes on natural drinking as well as drinking, alcohol effects, and response to naltrexone in the bar-lab setting were examined by genotype. There were no significant main effects of naltrexone or OPRM1 genotype, or any medication by OPRM1 interaction, on drinking variables. However, in individuals who had at least one DAT 9 VNTR, and who were also OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes, naltrexone reduced drinks/d consumed under natural conditions (p = 0.006), but not in the bar-lab. OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes (p = 0.028) and DAT 9 VNTR carriers (p = 0.032) had more stimulation to alcohol after the priming drink. This study does not support a salient role for the OPRM1 asp40 alone in predicting drinking or naltrexone effects. However, although exploratory and in need of replication, it introduces the possibility that epistasis between the OPRM1 gene and DAT gene might need to be taken into account when examining differential genetic response to alcohol or medication treatment, especially in early-stage alcoholics. \n",

      "Association analysis between the A118G polymorphism in the OPRM1 gene and treatment response to venlafaxine XR in generalized anxiety disorder. Patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) exhibit differential responses to standard antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

In this study, we examined whether the OPRM1 gene, which has been implicated in antidepressant treatment response in major depressive disorder, also has an effect in GAD. In our study, 156 patients diagnosed with GAD received venlafaxine XR treatment as part of an 18-month relapse prevention study. Genotypes were obtained for the OPRM1 functional variant A118G for the entire sample (n = 151); however, only the European American population was considered (n = 108) for pharmacogenetic analysis. We found no significant association between A118G and antidepressant treatment response in our GAD population. Future studies that include different single nucleotide polymorphisms of the OPRM1 gene as well as larger populations will need to be conducted to further elucidate the pharmacogenetic role of the endogenous opioid system in anxiety disorders. \n",

      "A pilot controlled trial of bupropion XL versus escitalopram in generalized anxiety disorder. To compare the efficacy and safety of bupropion XL (150 to 300 mg/day) with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram (10 to 20 mg/day) in outpatients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Twenty-four participants with GAD between 18 and 64 years enrolled in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized trial. The primary efficacy measures were the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Bupropion XL demonstrated comparable anxiolytic efficacy to escitalopram in outpatients with GAD. Both treatments were well-tolerated. Findings from this pilot project suggest that bupropion XL may be useful in treating GAD. These preliminary results warrant further research to explore the use of bupropion XL in the treatment of GAD. \n",

      "1. **GABBR1 and Neuropsychiatric Disorders**: The first abstract discusses polymorphisms at various loci of neuropsychiatric interest, including genes like OPRM1, SLC6A3, and others. While GABBR1 is not directly mentioned, it is known to be involved in the GABAergic system, which plays a significant role in neuropsychiatric conditions. The GABAergic system's modulation can influence various neurotransmitter systems, including those involving dopamine and opioids, which are discussed in the abstracts.\n",

      "2. **Baclofen and GABA Receptors**: Baclofen is a well-known GABA_B receptor agonist. It is used to treat spasticity and has been investigated for its potential in treating alcohol dependence and other neuropsychiatric conditions. The GABA_B receptor, which Baclofen targets, is encoded by the GABBR1 gene.\n",

      "The A9 allele of the dopamine transporter gene is associated with delirium tremens and alcohol-withdrawal seizure. The dopamine transporter (DAT) plays a key role in homeostatic regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission and could thus be involved in the variability of two severe alcohol-withdrawal symptoms, alcohol-withdrawal seizure (AWS) and delirium tremens (DT). Interestingly, an association was found between the DAT gene (9-copy repeat) and the risk for these symptoms in two previous case-control studies. We reanalyzed the role of the DAT gene in the lifetime risk for AWS and DT in 120 alcohol-dependent patients, taking into account potentially confounding factors. Alcohol-dependent patients with the A(9) allele had experienced AWS or DT at least once (odds ratio [OR] = 2.52, p =.03). This association persisted when excluding patients with antisocial personality comorbidity (OR = 3.48, p =.02) or limiting the analysis to older patients (OR = 8.3, p =.0008). This study provides convergent data in favor of a significant role of the DAT gene in the risk for some severe withdrawal symptoms. If further replicated in larger samples, the DAT genetic polymorphism could be one of the factors to be analyzed to further assess the risk of some severe alcohol-withdrawal symptoms. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms and Genetic Factors**:\n",
      "   - The first abstract discusses the association between the A9 allele of the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene and severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as alcohol-withdrawal seizure (AWS) and delirium tremens (DT). This suggests that genetic factors, particularly those affecting dopaminergic neurotransmission, play a role in the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **GABBR1 and Alcohol Withdrawal**:\n",
      "   - GABBR1 (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type B Receptor Subunit 1) is a gene that encodes a subunit of the GABA_B receptor, which is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. GABA_B receptors are known to play a role in modulating neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability, which can be crucial during alcohol withdrawal when the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance is disrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Baclofen and GABA_B Receptors**:\n",
      "   - Baclofen is a medication that acts as a GABA_B receptor agonist. It mimics the action of GABA (the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain) at GABA_B receptors, thereby exerting a calming effect on neuronal activity. Baclofen has been used off-label to manage symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and to reduce alcohol craving, leveraging its action on GABA_B receptors.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Indirect Relationship**:\n",
      "   - The indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be described as follows: GABBR1 encodes a component of the GABA_B receptor, which is the target of Baclofen. In the context of alcohol withdrawal, where genetic factors like the DAT gene polymorphism influence symptom severity, the modulation of GABA_B receptors by Baclofen can help manage these symptoms. Therefore, while GABBR1 and Baclofen are not directly linked in the provided abstracts, they are connected through the broader context of alcohol withdrawal management and the neurobiological mechanisms involved.\n",

      "Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. \n",

      "Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. \n",

      "Analysis of dopamine transporter gene expression pattern -- generation of DAT-iCre transgenic mice. The dopamine transporter is an essential component of the dopaminergic synapse. It is located in the presynaptic neurons and regulates extracellular dopamine levels. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the dopamine transporter gene, for investigations of gene function in dopaminergic neurons. The codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. The pattern of expression of the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene was similar to that of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene, as shown by immunohistochemistry. Recombinase activity was further studied in mice carrying both the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene and a construct expressing the beta-galactosidase gene after Cre-mediated recombination. In situ studies showed that beta-galactosidase (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl beta-D-galactoside staining) and the dopamine transporter (immunofluorescence) had identical distributions in the ventral midbrain. We used this animal model to study the distribution of dopamine transporter gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei in detail. The expression profile of tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis) was broader than that of beta-galactosidase in A12 to A15. Thus, only a fraction of neurons synthesizing dopamine expressed the dopamine transporter gene. The bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgenic line is a unique tool for targeting Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination to dopamine neurons for studies of gene function or for labeling living cells, following the crossing of these mice with transgenic Cre reporter lines producing fluorescent proteins. \n",

      "Roche DAT immunoassay: sensitivity and specificity testing for amphetamines, cocaine, and opiates in oral fluid. Laboratory testing of oral fluid for drugs of abuse continues to expand in the workplace, legal, treatment, and health settings. In this study, we assessed recently developed homogeneous Roche DAT screening assays for amphetamines, cocaine metabolite [benzoylecgonine (BZE)], methamphetamines, and opiates in oral fluid. Precision and accuracy were assessed using control samples at +/-25% of cutoff. Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement compared to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was assessed by analysis of oral fluid specimens collected from 994 subjects enrolled in a drug treatment or probation and parole drug-testing program. An additional 180 research specimens from Kroll Laboratories were analyzed for amphetamine and methamphetamine. Screening cutoff concentrations (ng/mL) were as follows: amphetamines, 40; cocaine metabolite, 3; methamphetamines, 40; and opiates, 10. LC-MS-MS analyses were performed with the following cutoff concentrations (ng/mL): amphetamine, 40; BZE, 2.0; methamphetamine, 40; and codeine or morphine, 10. The percent coefficient of variation ranged from 3.4% to 7.3%. Sensitivity and specificity of the Roche DAT assays compared to LC-MS-MS were > 94%, and agreement was > 96% for the four assays. The performance of the Roche DAT assays suggests these new homogeneous screening assays will be an attractive alternative to existing more labor-intensive enzyme immunoassays. \n",

      "Bupropion interference with immunoassays for amphetamines and LSD. A 50-year-old male patient suddenly had lost consciousness, although he had previously been healthy. On arrival at hospital seizures arose. The authors investigated a urine sample of the patient, and performed toxicological drug screening with immunochemical Cloned Enzyme Donor Immunoassay (CEDIA) assays. Positive findings for amphetamines and LSD could not be confirmed. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), the authors identified bupropion, a drug used to aid in smoking cessation, as the interfering compound, which may cause false-positive results for amphetamines and LSD using the CEDIA assays. \n",

      "Sequences and polymorphisms of the canine monoamine transporter genes SLC6A2, SLC6A3, and SLC6A4 among five dog breeds. Monoamine transporters have roles to regulate the monoamine concentrations in synaptic clefts in the central nervous system and are the targets of antidepressants and psychostimulants. They include transporters for norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin, which are encoded by the SLC6A2, SLC6A3, and SLC6A4 genes, respectivily. We sequenced the full lengths of the coding regions of these genes for dogs and identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC6A2 and four in SLC6A3. One SLC6A3 SNP was non-synonymous and caused an amino acid substitution from threonine to serine. The genotype frequencies of these polymorphisms differed significantly among five breeds with different behavioral traits, suggesting that novel SLC6A2 and SLC6A3 SNPs would provide additional useful information for behavioral genetic studies in dogs. \n",

      "Diagnostic accuracy of imaging brain vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) in clinically uncertain parkinsonian syndrome (CUPS): a 3-year follow-up study in community patients. To further validate the diagnostic utility of 18F-AV-133 vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with clinically uncertain parkinsonian syndromes (CUPS) by comparison to clinical diagnosis at 3 years follow-up. In a previous study, we reported that 18F-AV-133 PET in community patients with CUPS changed diagnosis and management and increased diagnostic confidence. The current diagnosis of this cohort was obtained from the patient and treating specialist and compared with the diagnosis suggested 3 years earlier by the 18F-AV-133 PET. A second 18F-AV-133 PET was available in those with a discordant or inconclusive final diagnosis. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who had a follow-up clinical diagnosis, which was concordant with their initial 18F-AV-133 PET scan. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients who had the same diagnosis at follow-up as that reached after the initial scan and the stability of diagnostic changes made after the first scan. 81 of the 85 patients previously recruited to the CUPS study had follow-up of which 79 had a clinical diagnosis and 2 remained CUPS. The diagnosis was in agreement with the initial 18F-AV-133 PET scan result in 74 cases. Five patients had a discordant diagnosis; one patient with rubral tremor had a severely abnormal scan that had worsened when rescanned; four cases with normal initial and repeat scans had a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Two patients with suspected genetic disorders remained classified as CUPS and both had normal scans. In the 24 CUPS cohort patients where 18F-AV-133 PET initially changed diagnosis, this change was supported by follow-up diagnosis in all but the one rubral tremor case. 18F-AV-133 PET is a useful tool in improving diagnostic accuracy in CUPS providing results and diagnostic changes that remain robust after 3 years follow-up. \n",

      "Association of DNA polymorphisms in the synaptic vesicular amine transporter gene (SLC18A2) with alcohol and nicotine dependence. The brain synaptic vesicular amine transporter SLCA18A2 is a key component for the uptake of monoamines like dopamine or serotonin into vesicles. We have analyzed seven DNA polymorphisms located in the genomic region of SLC18A2 for association with alcohol- and nicotine dependence, using a family-based design. Our sample comprised 131 families with alcohol-dependent offspring and 96 families with at least one nicotine-dependent offspring. For the alcohol-dependent sample, we found statistical significant association for two single markers (rs363387, P=0.03; rs363333, P=0.0066) as well as for several haplotypes (minimal P=0.0038). When the sample with alcohol dependence was stratified according to gender, we observed increased association for the male subgroup (rs363387, P=0.0011). None of the markers showed association in the sample of families with nicotine dependence. However, analysis of a combined sample of alcohol and nicotine-dependent families resulted in single markers as well as several haplotypes showing statistical significant association with substance dependence (minimal P=0.0044). We conclude that DNA polymorphisms located in SLC18A2 might contribute to the development of substance dependence. \n",

      "Dopamine transporter (Dat) and synaptic vesicle amine transporter (VMAT2) gene expression in the substantia nigra of control and Parkinson's disease. The cellular expression of DAT mRNA and VMAT2 mRNA was investigated in sections of the human post-mortem substantia nigra in control and Parkinson's disease tissue using in situ hybridisation techniques. Short synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were used to detect these gene transcripts at the cellular level. In the control human nigra, high levels of expression were seen in all sub-divisions of the substantia nigra, especially within medial regions. By contrast, the level of expression of both DAT mRNA and VMAT2 mRNA was markedly reduced in Parkinson's disease; these reductions in hybridisation signal were associated with (i) a marked loss of dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra, and (ii) a reduction in both DAT and VMAT2 signal per cell in the remaining pigmented neurones. These disease-related decreases in the cellular abundance of both DAT and VMAT2 gene transcripts in the surviving cells of the parkinsonian nigra may reflect compensatory changes in catecholamine signalling or may be a consequence of neuronal dysfunction. \n",

      "Gain of function mutants reveal sites important for the interaction of the atypical inhibitors benztropine and bupropion with monoamine transporters. Two atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter, benztropine, used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and bupropion, used as an antidepressant, show very different psychostimulant effects when compared with another inhibitor, cocaine. Taking advantage of the differential sensitivity of the dopamine and the norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET) to benztropine and bupropion, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to produce gain-of-function mutants in NET which demonstrate that Ala279 in the trans-membrane domain 5 (TM5) and Ser359 in the TM7 of DAT are responsible for the higher sensitivity of DAT to both bupropion and benztropine. Substitution of these two DAT residues into the NET background does not alter the potency of NET-selective inhibitors, such as desipramine. The results from experiments examining the ability of DAT-selective inhibitors to displace [3H]nisoxetine binding in NET gain-of-function mutants suggest that Ser359 contributes to the initial binding of the inhibitor, and that Ala279 may influence subsequent steps involved in the blockade of translocation. Thus, these studies begin to identify residues that are important for the unique molecular interactions of benztropine and bupropion with the DAT, and that ultimately may contribute to the distinct behavioral actions of these drugs. \n",

      "Enantioselective effects of hydroxy metabolites of bupropion on behavior and on function of monoamine transporters and nicotinic receptors. Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that also has usefulness as a smoking-cessation aid. Because hydroxybupropion, a major metabolite of bupropion, is believed to contribute to its antidepressant activity, this metabolite may also contribute to the smoking-cessation properties of bupropion. This study investigated the effects of hydrobupropion enantiomers on monoamine transporters and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes. Racemic bupropion and hydroxybupropion inhibit [(3)H]norepinephrine (NE) uptake with similar potency (IC(50) values of 1.9 and 1.7 microM, respectively), but most of the latter activity resides in the (2S,3S)-hydroxy isomer (IC(50) = 520 nM) rather than (2S,3R)-hydroxybupropion (IC(50) > 10,000 nM). Similar results were found with [(3)H]dopamine (DA) uptake. The effects of bupropion and enantiomers of hydroxybupropion on human nAChR subtypes indicate that the (2S,3S) isomer is more potent than the (2S,3R) isomer or racemic bupropion as an antagonist of alpha(4)beta(2) (functional IC(50) = 3.3 microM). In addition, (2S,3S)-hyroxybupropion and bupropion were considerably more potent than (2R, -3R)-hydroxybupropion in a mouse depression model (forced swimming test) and in antagonism of acute nicotine effects in mice. Together, our results suggest that clinical and behavioral effects of bupropion arise from actions at nAChR as well as DA and NE transporters. Furthermore, our data suggest that the (2S,3S)-hydroxybupropion isomer may be a better drug candidate for smoking cessation than bupropion because of its higher potency at the relevant targets. \n",

      "**Indirect Relationship Between GABBR1 and Baclofen:**\n",

      "GABBR1 is a receptor that is part of the GABA_B receptor complex, which plays a crucial role in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Baclofen is a pharmacological agent known to interact with the GABA_B receptor complex. However, the relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen is not direct in the sense that Baclofen does not specifically bind to GABBR1 alone but rather to the GABA_B receptor complex as a whole, which includes GABBR1 as one of its subunits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of the provided abstracts, the focus is on various transporters and their roles in neurotransmission and the effects of different substances on these transporters. For instance, the abstracts discuss the roles of monoamine transporters (such as SLC6A2, SLC6A3, and SLC6A4) in regulating neurotransmitter levels and their implications in conditions like Parkinson's disease and substance dependence. These transporters are involved in the uptake and regulation of neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, which are crucial for maintaining synaptic balance and proper neuronal function.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the abstracts do not directly address GABBR1 or Baclofen, they highlight the importance of understanding the interactions between various neurotransmitter systems and their transporters. Baclofen, by acting on the GABA_B receptor complex, indirectly influences the overall neurotransmitter balance in the brain, which can have downstream effects on other neurotransmitter systems, including those regulated by the transporters mentioned in the abstracts.\n",

      "Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. \n",

      "Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. \n",

      "Analysis of dopamine transporter gene expression pattern -- generation of DAT-iCre transgenic mice. The dopamine transporter is an essential component of the dopaminergic synapse. It is located in the presynaptic neurons and regulates extracellular dopamine levels. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the dopamine transporter gene, for investigations of gene function in dopaminergic neurons. The codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. The pattern of expression of the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene was similar to that of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene, as shown by immunohistochemistry. Recombinase activity was further studied in mice carrying both the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene and a construct expressing the beta-galactosidase gene after Cre-mediated recombination. In situ studies showed that beta-galactosidase (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl beta-D-galactoside staining) and the dopamine transporter (immunofluorescence) had identical distributions in the ventral midbrain. We used this animal model to study the distribution of dopamine transporter gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei in detail. The expression profile of tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis) was broader than that of beta-galactosidase in A12 to A15. Thus, only a fraction of neurons synthesizing dopamine expressed the dopamine transporter gene. The bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgenic line is a unique tool for targeting Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination to dopamine neurons for studies of gene function or for labeling living cells, following the crossing of these mice with transgenic Cre reporter lines producing fluorescent proteins. \n",

      "Effects of the nicotinic agonist varenicline, nicotinic antagonist r-bPiDI, and DAT inhibitor (R)-modafinil on co-use of ethanol and nicotine in female P rats. Co-users of alcohol and nicotine are the largest group of polysubstance users worldwide. Commonalities in mechanisms of action for ethanol (EtOH) and nicotine proposes the possibility of developing a single pharmacotherapeutic to treat co-use. Toward developing a preclinical model of co-use, female alcohol-preferring (P) rats were trained for voluntary EtOH drinking and i.v. nicotine self-administration in three phases: (1) EtOH alone (0 vs. 15%, two-bottle choice), (2) nicotine alone (0.03 mg/kg/infusion, active vs. inactive lever), and (3) concurrent access to both EtOH and nicotine. Using this model, we examined the effects of (1) varenicline, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist with high affinity for the alpha4beta2* subtype; (2) r-bPiDI, a subtype-selective antagonist at alpha6beta2* nAChRs; and (3) (R)-modafinil, an atypical inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT). In phases 1 and 2, pharmacologically relevant intake of EtOH and nicotine was achieved. In the concurrent access phase (phase 3), EtOH consumption decreased while nicotine intake increased relative to phases 1 and 2. For drug pretreatments, in the EtOH access phase (phase 1), (R)-modafinil (100 mg/kg) decreased EtOH consumption, with no effect on water consumption. In the concurrent access phase, varenicline (3 mg/kg), r-bPiDI (20 mg/kg), and (R)-modafinil (100 mg/kg) decreased nicotine self-administration but did not alter EtOH consumption, water consumption, or inactive lever pressing. These results indicate that therapeutics which may be useful for smoking cessation via selective inhibition of alpha4beta2* or alpha6beta2* nAChRs, or DAT inhibition, may not be sufficient to treat EtOH and nicotine co-use. \n",

      "Cost effectiveness of varenicline versus bupropion and unaided cessation for smoking cessation in a cohort of Finnish adult smokers. To assess the cost effectiveness of varenicline compared with bupropion or unaided cessation for smoking cessation in Finnish adult smokers. The BENESCO (BENEfits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes) Markov model was used to follow a hypothetical cohort of smokers making a single quit attempt over a lifetime. Gender and age-specific data on the incidence and prevalence of five smoking-related diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], lung cancer, coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke and asthma exacerbations) were included in the model. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total treatment costs and the lifetime cumulative incidence of these parameters were the primary outcomes evaluated, and they were compared for varenicline versus bupropion and varenicline versus unaided cessation. The primary data were derived from Finnish publications and databases. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the base-case model. The treatment cohort comprised 229 301 smokers making a quit attempt. In the lifetime simulation, use of varenicline prevented 1965 and 5057 additional cases of smoking-related disease, and 1184 and 3047 deaths attributable to smoking, when compared with bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. Compared with bupropion and unaided cessation varenicline treatment yielded 4392 and 11 303 additional LYs (4851 and 12 485 QALYs), respectively. Varenicline resulted in cost savings of 15 million and 43 million euros (euro) compared with bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. In the 20-year time horizon analysis, varenicline yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro8791/QALY and euro7791/QALY gained in comparison to bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the base-case results for varenicline. Varenicline dominated over its comparators, i.e. it was more effective and resulted in cost saving compared with bupropion and unaided cessation. \n",

      "Combined administration of varenicline and bupropion produces additive effects on accumbal dopamine and abolishes the alcohol deprivation effect in rats. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is detrimental to health and causes preterm death. Unfortunately, available pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments have small effect sizes, and improved treatments are needed. Smoking and AUD share heritability and are pharmacologically associated, since drug-induced dopamine (DA) output in nucleus accumbens (nAc) involves nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in both cases. Smoking therapy agents, such as the partial nAChR agonist varenicline or the DA/noradrenaline transporter inhibitor bupropion, could potentially also be used for AUD. To investigate this hypothesis, the effects of varenicline, bupropion, or a combination of the two on nAc DA levels, ethanol intake, and the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) were examined. In vivo microdialysis showed that varenicline (1.5 mg/kg) and bupropion (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg) elevated nAc DA levels and that the combination produced additive effects. Five days treatment with varenicline, bupropion, or the combination did not suppress ethanol consumption, as compared with vehicle-treated control. However, combined administration of varenicline and bupropion completely blocked the ADE when readministering ethanol following 14 days of abstinence. Since ADE is considered highly predictive for the clinical outcome in man, our data suggest that the combination of varenicline and bupropion could be a promising treatment for AUD. \n",

      "Bupropion-varenicline interactions and nicotine self-administration behavior in rats. Varenicline and bupropion each have been shown to significantly improve cessation of tobacco addiction in humans. They act through different mechanisms and the question about the potential added efficacy with their combined used has arisen. Preclinical animal models of nicotine addiction can help with the evaluation of this combined approach and what dose combinations of varenicline and bupropion may be useful for enhancing tobacco cessation. In this study, we investigated the interacting dose-effect functions of varenicline and bupropion in a rat model of nicotine self-administration. Young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were allowed to self-administer nicotine in 1-h sessions under an FR1 reinforcement schedule. Varenicline (0.3, 1. 3 mg/kg) and bupropion (8.33, 25, 75 mg/kg) were administered alone or together 15 min before each session. The vehicle saline was the control. Higher doses of each drug alone reduced nicotine self-administration compared to control with reductions of 62% and 75% with 3 mg/kg varenicline and 75 mg/kg bupropion respectively. Lower dose varenicline which does not by itself reduce nicotine self-administration, significantly augmented bupropion effects. The 0.3 mg/kg varenicline dose combined with the 25 and 75 mg/kg bupropion doses caused greater reductions of nicotine self-administration than either dose of bupropion given alone. However, higher dose varenicline did not have this effect. Lower dose bupropion did not augment varenicline effects. Only the high bupropion dose significantly enhanced the varenicline effect. Likewise, combining 1 mg/kg varenicline with 75 mg/kg bupropion reduced self-administration to a greater extent than either dose alone. These results demonstrate that combination therapy with varenicline and bupropion may be more beneficial than monotherapy with either drug alone. \n",

      "Given the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between GABBR1 (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type B Receptor Subunit 1) and Baclofen can be described through the involvement of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopaminergic pathways in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dopaminergic Pathways and DAT**: The abstracts highlight the role of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in conditions such as Tourette syndrome (TS), cancer progression, and substance use disorders. DAT is crucial in regulating dopamine levels in the brain, and its polymorphisms and expression patterns are associated with various neuropsychiatric and oncological conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Baclofen and GABBR1**: Baclofen is a GABAB receptor agonist, and GABBR1 is a subunit of the GABAB receptor. Baclofen's primary mechanism of action is through the activation of GABAB receptors, which are involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Indirect Relationship via Dopaminergic Modulation**:\n",
      "   - **Tourette Syndrome and Dopaminergic Abnormalities**: The first abstract discusses the association of DAT polymorphisms with TS, suggesting a dopaminergic abnormality in the disorder. Baclofen, by activating GABAB receptors, can modulate dopaminergic activity indirectly. GABAB receptor activation can inhibit the release of dopamine, thereby potentially influencing conditions like TS that are associated with dopaminergic dysregulation.\n",
      "   - **Substance Use Disorders**: The abstracts on varenicline, bupropion, and their effects on nicotine and alcohol use highlight the role of dopaminergic pathways in addiction. Baclofen has been studied for its potential in treating substance use disorders by modulating GABAergic and dopaminergic systems. By activating GABAB receptors, Baclofen can reduce dopamine release, which may help in reducing the reinforcing effects of addictive substances.\n",
      "   - **Cancer and DAT**: The second abstract mentions the role of DAT in cancer progression and the potential repurposing of benztropine, a DAT inhibitor, for anticancer therapy. While this is a more distant connection, it highlights the broad impact of dopaminergic modulation in various conditions. Baclofen's indirect modulation of dopamine through GABAB receptors could theoretically influence similar pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be described through their involvement in modulating dopaminergic pathways. Baclofen, by activating GABAB receptors (which include GABBR1), can influence dopamine release and activity, thereby impacting conditions associated with dopaminergic dysregulation, such as Tourette syndrome, substance use disorders, and potentially even cancer progression.\n",

To assess the cost effectiveness of varenicline compared with bupropion or unaided cessation for smoking cessation in Finnish adult smokers. The BENESCO (BENEfits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes) Markov model was used to follow a hypothetical cohort of smokers making a single quit attempt over a lifetime. Gender and age-specific data on the incidence and prevalence of five smoking-related diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], lung cancer, coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke and asthma exacerbations) were included in the model. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total treatment costs and the lifetime cumulative incidence of these parameters were the primary outcomes evaluated, and they were compared for varenicline versus bupropion and varenicline versus unaided cessation. The primary data were derived from Finnish publications and databases. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the base-case model. The treatment cohort comprised 229 301 smokers making a quit attempt. In the lifetime simulation, use of varenicline prevented 1965 and 5057 additional cases of smoking-related disease, and 1184 and 3047 deaths attributable to smoking, when compared with bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. Compared with bupropion and unaided cessation varenicline treatment yielded 4392 and 11 303 additional LYs (4851 and 12 485 QALYs), respectively. Varenicline resulted in cost savings of 15 million and 43 million euros (euro) compared with bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. In the 20-year time horizon analysis, varenicline yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro8791/QALY and euro7791/QALY gained in comparison to bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the base-case results for varenicline. Varenicline dominated over its comparators, i.e. it was more effective and resulted in cost saving compared with bupropion and unaided cessation. ', 'Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. ', 'Bupropion-varenicline interactions and nicotine self-administration behavior in rats. Varenicline and bupropion each have been shown to significantly improve cessation of tobacco addiction in humans. They act through different mechanisms and the question about the potential added efficacy with their combined used has arisen. Preclinical animal models of nicotine addiction can help with the evaluation of this combined approach and what dose combinations of varenicline and bupropion may be useful for enhancing tobacco cessation. In this study, we investigated the interacting dose-effect functions of varenicline and bupropion in a rat model of nicotine self-administration. Young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were allowed to self-administer nicotine in 1-h sessions under an FR1 reinforcement schedule. Varenicline (0.3, 1. 3 mg/kg) and bupropion (8.33, 25, 75 mg/kg) were administered alone or together 15 min before each session. The vehicle saline was the control. Higher doses of each drug alone reduced nicotine self-administration compared to control with reductions of 62% and 75% with 3 mg/kg varenicline and 75 mg/kg bupropion respectively. Lower dose varenicline which does not by itself reduce nicotine self-administration, significantly augmented bupropion effects. The 0.3 mg/kg varenicline dose combined with the 25 and 75 mg/kg bupropion doses caused greater reductions of nicotine self-administration than either dose of bupropion given alone. However, higher dose varenicline did not have this effect. Lower dose bupropion did not augment varenicline effects. Only the high bupropion dose significantly enhanced the varenicline effect. Likewise, combining 1 mg/kg varenicline with 75 mg/kg bupropion reduced self-administration to a greater extent than either dose alone. These results demonstrate that combination therapy with varenicline and bupropion may be more beneficial than monotherapy with either drug alone. ', 'Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. ', 'Effects of the nicotinic agonist varenicline, nicotinic antagonist r-bPiDI, and DAT inhibitor (R)-modafinil on co-use of ethanol and nicotine in female P rats. Co-users of alcohol and nicotine are the largest group of polysubstance users worldwide. Commonalities in mechanisms of action for ethanol (EtOH) and nicotine proposes the possibility of developing a single pharmacotherapeutic to treat co-use. Toward developing a preclinical model of co-use, female alcohol-preferring (P) rats were trained for voluntary EtOH drinking and i.v. nicotine self-administration in three phases: (1) EtOH alone (0 vs. 15%, two-bottle choice), (2) nicotine alone (0.03 mg/kg/infusion, active vs. inactive lever), and (3) concurrent access to both EtOH and nicotine. Using this model, we examined the effects of (1) varenicline, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist with high affinity for the alpha4beta2* subtype; (2) r-bPiDI, a subtype-selective antagonist at alpha6beta2* nAChRs; and (3) (R)-modafinil, an atypical inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT). In phases 1 and 2, pharmacologically relevant intake of EtOH and nicotine was achieved. In the concurrent access phase (phase 3), EtOH consumption decreased while nicotine intake increased relative to phases 1 and 2. For drug pretreatments, in the EtOH access phase (phase 1), (R)-modafinil (100 mg/kg) decreased EtOH consumption, with no effect on water consumption. In the concurrent access phase, varenicline (3 mg/kg), r-bPiDI (20 mg/kg), and (R)-modafinil (100 mg/kg) decreased nicotine self-administration but did not alter EtOH consumption, water consumption, or inactive lever pressing. These results indicate that therapeutics which may be useful for smoking cessation via selective inhibition of alpha4beta2* or alpha6beta2* nAChRs, or DAT inhibition, may not be sufficient to treat EtOH and nicotine co-use. ', 'Analysis of dopamine transporter gene expression pattern -- generation of DAT-iCre transgenic mice. The dopamine transporter is an essential component of the dopaminergic synapse. It is located in the presynaptic neurons and regulates extracellular dopamine levels. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the dopamine transporter gene, for investigations of gene function in dopaminergic neurons. The codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. The pattern of expression of the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene was similar to that of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene, as shown by immunohistochemistry. Recombinase activity was further studied in mice carrying both the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene and a construct expressing the beta-galactosidase gene after Cre-mediated recombination. In situ studies showed that beta-galactosidase (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl beta-D-galactoside staining) and the dopamine transporter (immunofluorescence) had identical distributions in the ventral midbrain. We used this animal model to study the distribution of dopamine transporter gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei in detail. The expression profile of tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis) was broader than that of beta-galactosidase in A12 to A15. Thus, only a fraction of neurons synthesizing dopamine expressed the dopamine transporter gene. The bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgenic line is a unique tool for targeting Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination to dopamine neurons for studies of gene function or for labeling living cells, following the crossing of these mice with transgenic Cre reporter lines producing fluorescent proteins. ', 'Combination bupropion SR and varenicline for smoking cessation: a systematic review. Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death in the world. Current cessation medications include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion, while combination therapy primarily entails NRT with either varenicline or bupropion. However, recent studies have examined varenicline and bupropion in combination. A systematic review assessing the efficacy and safety of combination varenicline and bupropion was conducted. PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched using terms: \"varenicline combination\", \"bupropion combination\", \"bupropion AND varenicline\", and \"bupropion AND varenicline combination smoking cessation\", yielding four studies including 1193 total patients. Combination therapy yielded greater efficacy than varenicline monotherapy in two randomized controlled trials and one retrospective outcomes study. One single-arm Phase II trial provided additional efficacy and safety data. Of the prospective trials, one displayed a greater 4-week smoking abstinence for weeks 8-11 with combination (39.8%) versus monotherapy (25.9%) (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.07-3.35). The other demonstrated greater prolonged abstinence (continuous abstinence from week 2) at 12 weeks (OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.05-2.12) and 26 weeks (OR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.04-2.22), though results were not significant at 52 weeks in this study. The retrospective study displayed higher success rates (continuous abstinence rates at 52 weeks) with combination varenicline and bupropion (55.0%; compared to varenicline monotherapy (32.1%), p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses suggest that this combination may be more beneficial in males and patients with higher baseline nicotine dependence. To the authors\\' knowledge, this is the first review conducted to compile current literature on this novel pharmacotherapy combination for smoking cessation. Combination bupropion SR and varenicline displayed greater efficacy in smoking cessation than varenicline monotherapy, though further safety analysis is warranted to rule out additive psychiatric adverse effects.

      "1. **GABBR1 and Baclofen Mechanism**: GABBR1 is a subunit of the GABA_B receptor, which is a metabotropic receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Baclofen is a GABA_B receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates GABA_B receptors, including those containing the GABBR1 subunit. This activation leads to various physiological effects, including muscle relaxation and reduction of spasticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Indirect Relationship through Dopaminergic System**: The abstracts discuss various pharmacological agents and their effects on the dopaminergic system, particularly focusing on the dopamine transporter (DAT) and its role in conditions like nicotine addiction, Tourette syndrome, and co-use of ethanol and nicotine. Although GABBR1 and Baclofen are not directly mentioned, there is an indirect connection through the modulation of the dopaminergic system. GABA_B receptor activation by Baclofen can influence dopaminergic neurotransmission, as GABAergic neurons often modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Potential Overlapping Therapeutic Areas**: Baclofen, through its action on GABA_B receptors, may have potential therapeutic effects in conditions where dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated, such as addiction and neuropsychiatric disorders. The abstracts highlight the importance of the dopaminergic system in these conditions, suggesting that Baclofen could indirectly affect outcomes by modulating GABAergic inhibition of dopaminergic pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Research Implications**: The studies on varenicline, bupropion, and other dopaminergic agents underscore the complexity of neurotransmitter interactions in addiction and neuropsychiatric disorders. While the primary focus is on the dopaminergic system, the role of GABAergic modulation, including through agents like Baclofen, could be an area of further research. Understanding how GABBR1 activation by Baclofen influences dopaminergic activity could provide insights into new therapeutic strategies.\n",

      "New contexts at iteration 2 for path 364: ['Combined administration of varenicline and bupropion produces additive effects on accumbal dopamine and abolishes the alcohol deprivation effect in rats. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is detrimental to health and causes preterm death. Unfortunately, available pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments have small effect sizes, and improved treatments are needed. Smoking and AUD share heritability and are pharmacologically associated, since drug-induced dopamine (DA) output in nucleus accumbens (nAc) involves nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in both cases. Smoking therapy agents, such as the partial nAChR agonist varenicline or the DA/noradrenaline transporter inhibitor bupropion, could potentially also be used for AUD. To investigate this hypothesis, the effects of varenicline, bupropion, or a combination of the two on nAc DA levels, ethanol intake, and the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) were examined. In vivo microdialysis showed that varenicline (1.5 mg/kg) and bupropion (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg) elevated nAc DA levels and that the combination produced additive effects. Five days treatment with varenicline, bupropion, or the combination did not suppress ethanol consumption, as compared with vehicle-treated control. However, combined administration of varenicline and bupropion completely blocked the ADE when readministering ethanol following 14 days of abstinence. Since ADE is considered highly predictive for the clinical outcome in man, our data suggest that the combination of varenicline and bupropion could be a promising treatment for AUD. ', 'Cost effectiveness of varenicline versus bupropion and unaided cessation for smoking cessation in a cohort of Finnish adult smokers. To assess the cost effectiveness of varenicline compared with bupropion or unaided cessation for smoking cessation in Finnish adult smokers. The BENESCO (BENEfits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes) Markov model was used to follow a hypothetical cohort of smokers making a single quit attempt over a lifetime. Gender and age-specific data on the incidence and prevalence of five smoking-related diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], lung cancer, coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke and asthma exacerbations) were included in the model. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total treatment costs and the lifetime cumulative incidence of these parameters were the primary outcomes evaluated, and they were compared for varenicline versus bupropion and varenicline versus unaided cessation. The primary data were derived from Finnish publications and databases. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the base-case model. The treatment cohort comprised 229 301 smokers making a quit attempt. In the lifetime simulation, use of varenicline prevented 1965 and 5057 additional cases of smoking-related disease, and 1184 and 3047 deaths attributable to smoking, when compared with bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. Compared with bupropion and unaided cessation varenicline treatment yielded 4392 and 11 303 additional LYs (4851 and 12 485 QALYs), respectively. Varenicline resulted in cost savings of 15 million and 43 million euros (euro) compared with bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. In the 20-year time horizon analysis, varenicline yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro8791/QALY and euro7791/QALY gained in comparison to bupropion and unaided cessation, respectively. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the base-case results for varenicline. Varenicline dominated over its comparators, i.e. it was more effective and resulted in cost saving compared with bupropion and unaided cessation. ', 'Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. ', 'Bupropion-varenicline interactions and nicotine self-administration behavior in rats. Varenicline and bupropion each have been shown to significantly improve cessation of tobacco addiction in humans. They act through different mechanisms and the question about the potential added efficacy with their combined used has arisen. Preclinical animal models of nicotine addiction can help with the evaluation of this combined approach and what dose combinations of varenicline and bupropion may be useful for enhancing tobacco cessation. In this study, we investigated the interacting dose-effect functions of varenicline and bupropion in a rat model of nicotine self-administration. Young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were allowed to self-administer nicotine in 1-h sessions under an FR1 reinforcement schedule. Varenicline (0.3, 1. 3 mg/kg) and bupropion (8.33, 25, 75 mg/kg) were administered alone or together 15 min before each session. The vehicle saline was the control. Higher doses of each drug alone reduced nicotine self-administration compared to control with reductions of 62% and 75% with 3 mg/kg varenicline and 75 mg/kg bupropion respectively. Lower dose varenicline which does not by itself reduce nicotine self-administration, significantly augmented bupropion effects. The 0.3 mg/kg varenicline dose combined with the 25 and 75 mg/kg bupropion doses caused greater reductions of nicotine self-administration than either dose of bupropion given alone. However, higher dose varenicline did not have this effect. Lower dose bupropion did not augment varenicline effects. Only the high bupropion dose significantly enhanced the varenicline effect. Likewise, combining 1 mg/kg varenicline with 75 mg/kg bupropion reduced self-administration to a greater extent than either dose alone. These results demonstrate that combination therapy with varenicline and bupropion may be more beneficial than monotherapy with either drug alone. ', 'Combination bupropion SR and varenicline for smoking cessation: a systematic review. Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death in the world. Current cessation medications include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion, while combination therapy primarily entails NRT with either varenicline or bupropion. However, recent studies have examined varenicline and bupropion in combination. A systematic review assessing the efficacy and safety of combination varenicline and bupropion was conducted. PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched using terms: \"varenicline combination\", \"bupropion combination\", \"bupropion AND varenicline\", and \"bupropion AND varenicline combination smoking cessation\", yielding four studies including 1193 total patients. Combination therapy yielded greater efficacy than varenicline monotherapy in two randomized controlled trials and one retrospective outcomes study. One single-arm Phase II trial provided additional efficacy and safety data. Of the prospective trials, one displayed a greater 4-week smoking abstinence for weeks 8-11 with combination (39.8%) versus monotherapy (25.9%) (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.07-3.35). The other demonstrated greater prolonged abstinence (continuous abstinence from week 2) at 12 weeks (OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.05-2.12) and 26 weeks (OR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.04-2.22), though results were not significant at 52 weeks in this study. The retrospective study displayed higher success rates (continuous abstinence rates at 52 weeks) with combination varenicline and bupropion (55.0%; compared to varenicline monotherapy (32.1%), p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses suggest that this combination may be more beneficial in males and patients with higher baseline nicotine dependence. To the authors\\' knowledge, this is the first review conducted to compile current literature on this novel pharmacotherapy combination for smoking cessation. Combination bupropion SR and varenicline displayed greater efficacy in smoking cessation than varenicline monotherapy, though further safety analysis is warranted to rule out additive psychiatric adverse effects. ', 'Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. ', 'Effects of the nicotinic agonist varenicline, nicotinic antagonist r-bPiDI, and DAT inhibitor (R)-modafinil on co-use of ethanol and nicotine in female P rats. Co-users of alcohol and nicotine are the largest group of polysubstance users worldwide. Commonalities in mechanisms of action for ethanol (EtOH) and nicotine proposes the possibility of developing a single pharmacotherapeutic to treat co-use. Toward developing a preclinical model of co-use, female alcohol-preferring (P) rats were trained for voluntary EtOH drinking and i.v. nicotine self-administration in three phases: (1) EtOH alone (0 vs. 15%, two-bottle choice), (2) nicotine alone (0.03 mg/kg/infusion, active vs. inactive lever), and (3) concurrent access to both EtOH and nicotine. Using this model, we examined the effects of (1) varenicline, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist with high affinity for the alpha4beta2* subtype; (2) r-bPiDI, a subtype-selective antagonist at alpha6beta2* nAChRs; and (3) (R)-modafinil, an atypical inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT). In phases 1 and 2, pharmacologically relevant intake of EtOH and nicotine was achieved. In the concurrent access phase (phase 3), EtOH consumption decreased while nicotine intake increased relative to phases 1 and 2. For drug pretreatments, in the EtOH access phase (phase 1), (R)-modafinil (100 mg/kg) decreased EtOH consumption, with no effect on water consumption. In the concurrent access phase, varenicline (3 mg/kg), r-bPiDI (20 mg/kg), and (R)-modafinil (100 mg/kg) decreased nicotine self-administration but did not alter EtOH consumption, water consumption, or inactive lever pressing. These results indicate that therapeutics which may be useful for smoking cessation via selective inhibition of alpha4beta2* or alpha6beta2* nAChRs, or DAT inhibition, may not be sufficient to treat EtOH and nicotine co-use. ', \"Association study of the SLC6A3 VNTR (DAT) and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A polymorphisms with alcohol dependence in a population from northeastern Brazil. Alcohol dependence (AD) is a complex psychiatric disorder, affecting 5.4% of the general population lifetime, characterized by excessive alcohol consumption influenced by environmental risk factors and genetic factors. Genetic alterations in dopaminergic system are involved in the treatment and etiology of AD. The aim of this search was to test the association of the SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a transporter and receptor of the dopaminergic system, with AD through a study in a population of northeastern Brazil. The study design was a case-control that included 227 males of northeastern Brazil (113 alcoholics and 114 controls). Alcoholics were classified according to the DSM-IV criteria for AD and controls were subjects who had nonalcohol problems or who never drank. Genotyping was detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR and RFLP-PCR for DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A, and subsequent electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies and association of polymorphisms with AD were assessed by chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and odds ratio (OR) with a confidence interval of 95% and significance p < 0.05. Data were analyzed on BioEstat 5.3 software. The SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR was associated with AD, allelic, and genotypic frequencies were significantly different, respectively (A9 vs. A10: OR = 1.88; p = 0.01; A9/A9 vs. A10/A10: OR = 6.25; p = 0.02; A9/A9 vs. A9/A10 + A10A10: OR = 5.44; p = 0.03). However, there was no statistically significant difference when the allelic (p = 0.10) and genotypic (p > 0.05) frequencies for DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A were compared. These findings suggest that A9 allele and A9/A9 genotype of the SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR are involved in the vulnerability to AD in the population studied. However, for the DRD2/ANKK1 SNP does not present contributions to the development of AD. \"]\n",

      "Given the context provided by the scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be described as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GABBR1 and Baclofen Mechanism**: GABBR1 is a subunit of the GABA_B receptor, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Baclofen is a GABA_B receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates GABA_B receptors, including those containing the GABBR1 subunit. This activation leads to inhibitory neurotransmission, which can have various therapeutic effects, such as muscle relaxation and reduction of spasticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dopaminergic System and Addiction**: Several abstracts discuss the role of the dopaminergic system in addiction, particularly focusing on drugs like varenicline and bupropion, which influence dopamine levels and are used in treating nicotine and alcohol dependence. The dopaminergic system is also implicated in the effects of other substances and conditions, such as the use of benztropine in cancer and the genetic associations in Tourette syndrome and alcohol dependence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Indirect Link via Dopaminergic Modulation**: Although GABBR1 and Baclofen are primarily associated with the GABAergic system, there is an indirect link through the modulation of the dopaminergic system. Baclofen has been shown to influence dopamine release in certain brain regions, which can affect behaviors related to addiction and reward. This is relevant because the abstracts highlight the importance of dopamine in addiction and the potential for various treatments to modulate this system.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential Therapeutic Overlap**: The therapeutic effects of Baclofen on conditions like alcohol dependence may overlap with those of drugs that directly target the dopaminergic system, such as varenicline and bupropion. This suggests that while Baclofen acts through GABA_B receptors, its influence on dopamine release could contribute to its efficacy in treating addiction, creating an indirect relationship with the dopaminergic-focused treatments discussed in the abstracts.\n",

      "Association between harmful alcohol consumption behavior and dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene polymorphisms in a male Finnish population. Ethanol-induced dopamine (DA) release in the mesolimbic system may reinforce excessive alcohol intake and the progression of alcohol dependence. Within this reward system, the DA transporter (DAT1) plays a key role in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission through presynaptic DA reuptake. This study investigated whether DAT1 genetic variation was associated with either alcohol consumption behavior or alcohol dependence in a Finnish cohort. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms and a frequently studied 3'-untranslated region 40-bp variable number tandem repeat were genotyped in unrelated male Finnish participants selected from alcoholism clinical treatment facilities (n=104), or through the Finnish Population Register (n=201). All participants completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. We found significant evidence that the synonymous exon 2 rs6350 variant was positively associated with both alcohol consumption behavior (P=0.0004) and problem drinking (G allele, odds ratio: 3.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-10.78). A second single nucleotide polymorphism, rs463379 (intron 4), was negatively associated with alcohol dependence (A allele, odds ratio: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.94). However, two-locus haplotypic analysis of rs6350-rs463379 did not further increase the strength of association with the quantitative Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score trait (P=0.0024). The present findings suggest that DAT1 genetic variation influences drinking behavior in our Finnish population, where the rs6350 A and rs463379 G alleles provide a protective role against high alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence, respectively. A systematic search for DAT1 variants that affect gene function or expression in the Finnish and other populations is warranted. \n",

On arrival at hospital seizures arose. The authors investigated a urine sample of the patient, and performed toxicological drug screening with immunochemical Cloned Enzyme Donor Immunoassay (CEDIA) assays. Positive findings for amphetamines and LSD could not be confirmed. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), the authors identified bupropion, a drug used to aid in smoking cessation, as the interfering compound, which may cause false-positive results for amphetamines and LSD using the CEDIA assays. \n",

      "1. **GABBR1 and Baclofen**: GABBR1 is a gene that encodes the GABA_B receptor 1, which is part of the GABAergic system. Baclofen is a GABA_B receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates GABA_B receptors, including those encoded by GABBR1. Baclofen is often used to treat spasticity and has been investigated for its potential in treating alcohol dependence due to its effects on the GABAergic system.\n",

      "Antifungal treatment with carvacrol and eugenol of oral candidiasis in immunosuppressed rats. Carvacrol and eugenol, the main (phenolic) components of essential oils of some aromatic plants, were evaluated for their therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of experimental oral candidiasis induced by Candida albicans in immunosuppressed rats. This anticandidal activity was analyzed by microbiological and histopathological techniques, and it was compared with that of nystatin, which was used as a positive control. Microbiologically, carvacrol and eugenol significantly (p<0.05) reduced the number of colony forming units (CFU) sampled from the oral cavity of rats treated for eight consecutive days, compared to untreated control rats. Treatment with nystatin gave similar results. Histologically, the untreated control animals showed numerous hyphae on the epithelium of the dorsal surface of the tongue. In contrast no hyphal colonization of the epithelium was seen in carvacrol-treated animals, while in rats treated with eugenol, only a few focalized zones of the dorsal surface of the tongue were occupied by hyphae. In the nystatin treated group, hyphae were found in the folds of the tongue mucosa. Thus, the histological data were confirmed by the microbiological tests for carvacrol and eugenol, but not for the nystatin-treated group. Therefore, carvacrol and eugenol could be considered as strong antifungal agents and could be proposed as therapeutic agents for oral candidiasis. \n",

      "Development of oral candidiasis following initiation and rechallenge of extended-release bupropion in a geriatric patient. To report a case of oral candidiasis that developed in a 70-year-old white female both upon initiation and rechallenge of extended-release bupropion therapy. A 70-year-old female with a past medical history of osteoarthritis, degenerative joint disease, and polycythemia vera developed oral candidiasis on 2 occasions following initiation of extended-release bupropion for the treatment of recurrent depression. During both instances, the reaction occurred with an increased dose of the medication, suggesting the adverse event may have been dose-related. The patient had no risk factors for oral candidiasis aside from dry mouth at baseline that reportedly worsened on bupropion. Though there are no other reports to our knowledge describing the development of oral candidiasis with bupropion, the likelihood of this having been an adverse reaction in this patient is probable as indicated by a calculated score of 8 from the Naranjo Algorithm. The adverse event appeared following bupropion administration and improved over time following its discontinuation. The adverse event reappeared following readministration of the agent, and no alternative causes were able to be identified. Additionally, the reaction occurred following an increase in the dose on both occasions, with the lower dose having only resulted in worsening dry mouth. This case demonstrates that an additional adverse event to screen for with bupropion treatment is the development of oral candidiasis. This adverse event may be more likely to occur in the older adult population. \n",

      "An indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be described by understanding the broader context of their roles and interactions within the body, even though the provided abstracts do not directly mention either GABBR1 or Baclofen. Here’s how you can infer an indirect relationship:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GABBR1 and Baclofen**: GABBR1 is a gene that encodes the GABA_B receptor 1, which is part of the GABA_B receptor complex involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Baclofen is a medication that acts as a GABA_B receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates these receptors, thereby exerting its effects, such as muscle relaxation and antispasticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Context from Abstracts**:\n",
      "   - The first abstract discusses the antifungal properties of carvacrol and eugenol in treating oral candidiasis in immunosuppressed rats, comparing their efficacy to nystatin.\n",
      "   - The second abstract reports a case of oral candidiasis developing in a geriatric patient following the initiation and rechallenge of extended-release bupropion, an antidepressant.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Connecting the Dots**:\n",
      "   - **Immune System and GABA_B Receptors**: The immune system and the central nervous system are interconnected. GABA_B receptors, including those encoded by GABBR1, are known to play roles in modulating immune responses. Baclofen, by activating GABA_B receptors, can influence immune function.\n",
      "   - **Medication Side Effects and Immune Modulation**: Bupropion, as mentioned in the second abstract, led to oral candidiasis, suggesting an impact on the immune system. While bupropion primarily affects neurotransmitter reuptake (dopamine and norepinephrine), its side effects on the immune system could be indirectly related to neurotransmitter modulation.\n",
      "   - **Potential Indirect Relationship**: Baclofen, through its action on GABA_B receptors, might influence immune responses in a way that could either exacerbate or mitigate conditions like oral candidiasis. Although the abstracts do not directly link Baclofen or GABBR1 to oral candidiasis, the modulation of immune responses by GABA_B receptor activity provides a plausible indirect connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be inferred through their roles in neurotransmission and immune modulation. While the provided abstracts focus on antifungal treatments and the side effects of bupropion, understanding the broader physiological roles of GABA_B receptors and Baclofen allows for the conceptualization of their potential indirect interactions with conditions like oral candidiasis.\n",

      "Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. \n",

      "Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. \n",

      "Analysis of dopamine transporter gene expression pattern -- generation of DAT-iCre transgenic mice. The dopamine transporter is an essential component of the dopaminergic synapse. It is located in the presynaptic neurons and regulates extracellular dopamine levels. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the dopamine transporter gene, for investigations of gene function in dopaminergic neurons. The codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. The pattern of expression of the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene was similar to that of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene, as shown by immunohistochemistry. Recombinase activity was further studied in mice carrying both the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene and a construct expressing the beta-galactosidase gene after Cre-mediated recombination. In situ studies showed that beta-galactosidase (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl beta-D-galactoside staining) and the dopamine transporter (immunofluorescence) had identical distributions in the ventral midbrain. We used this animal model to study the distribution of dopamine transporter gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei in detail. The expression profile of tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis) was broader than that of beta-galactosidase in A12 to A15. Thus, only a fraction of neurons synthesizing dopamine expressed the dopamine transporter gene. The bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgenic line is a unique tool for targeting Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination to dopamine neurons for studies of gene function or for labeling living cells, following the crossing of these mice with transgenic Cre reporter lines producing fluorescent proteins. \n",

      "Repeated intermittent MDMA binges reduce DAT density in mice and SERT density in rats in reward regions of the adolescent brain. The popular recreational drug, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is often taken as intermittent binges by adolescents at dance clubs. The neurobiological mechanisms that underlie MDMA-induced psychiatric conditions are still poorly understood. In the present study, mimicking adolescent patterns of administration, repeated intermittent MDMA binges (3x5 mg/(kg day) given 3h apart, every 7th day for 4 weeks) were given to adolescent mice and rats. Behavioral responses in the open-field and autoradiographic ligand-binding to dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (SERT) transporters in reward regions of the brain were measured. In the open-field, total horizontal activity (HA) was significantly increased in both mice and rats following the first and third weekly administered MDMA binge. However, rats, but not mice, exhibited an enhanced activity in the centre of the open-field arena, indicating on reduced anxiety or enhanced impulsivity, which is known to be associated with altered serotonin activity. Specific binding of DAT, but not SERT, was significantly reduced in the mouse AcbSh and CPU using in vitro autoradiography. On the contrary, SERT, but not DAT density was significantly reduced in the AcbSh of rats. Taken together, our data provide evidence for differential regulation of DAT and SERT densities in reward-related brain regions of rats and mice after long-term intermittent administration of MDMA. \n",

      "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Alters Synaptic Dopamine Release in the Dorsal Striatum Through Nicotinic Receptors and DAT Inhibition. An increase of extracellular dopamine (DA) has been implicated in the psychostimulant properties of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Although this drug has been reported to affect the DA uptake transporter (DAT), it might activate other mechanisms to regulate the outflow of DA in the brain. Our aim was to examine the overall effects of MDMA on the release of DA in the striatum. We studied the effect of MDMA on stimulus-evoked synaptic DA release in dorsal striatal slices of mice using in vitro amperometric techniques. We also tested the effects of MDMA on the nicotine-induced responses in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) neurons using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. MDMA (1-30 uM) depressed the amplitude and prolonged the decay-time of synaptic DA release in the striatum. Interestingly, in the presence of the broad nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, and the more selective alpha4beta2 antagonist dihydrobetaerythroidine (DHbetaE), MDMA enhanced both peak and duration of DA release. A similar effect was found on cocaine-insensitive (DAT-CI) mice slices. Concentrations of MDMA higher than 100 uM enhanced striatal DA outflow that was in turn, reduced by cocaine. Electrophysiological recordings of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc showed that MDMA depressed the effects of nicotine. Our data are consistent with a prevalent MDMA-induced inhibition of the synaptic release of DA in the dorsal striatum mediated by an interaction with nicotinic receptors. This drug also blocks DAT acting on a different site from cocaine and, at higher concentrations, has amphetamine-like releasing properties. \n",

      "Interactions between bupropion and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in healthy subjects. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; \"ecstasy\") is a popular recreational drug. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of dopamine in the psychotropic effects of MDMA using bupropion to inhibit the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters through which MDMA releases dopamine and norepinephrine by investigating. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between bupropion and MDMA in 16 healthy subjects were investigated using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Bupropion reduced the MDMA-induced elevations in plasma norepinephrine concentrations and the heart rate response to MDMA. In contrast, bupropion increased plasma MDMA concentrations and prolonged its subjective effects. Conversely, MDMA increased plasma bupropion concentrations. These results indicate a role for the transporter-mediated release of norepinephrine in the cardiostimulant effects of MDMA but do not support a modulatory role for dopamine in the mood effects of MDMA. These results also indicate that the use of MDMA during therapy with bupropion may result in higher plasma concentrations of both MDMA and bupropion and enhanced mood effects but also result in lower cardiac stimulation. \n",

      "New contexts at iteration 1 for path 145: ['Repeated intermittent MDMA binges reduce DAT density in mice and SERT density in rats in reward regions of the adolescent brain. The popular recreational drug, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is often taken as intermittent binges by adolescents at dance clubs. The neurobiological mechanisms that underlie MDMA-induced psychiatric conditions are still poorly understood. In the present study, mimicking adolescent patterns of administration, repeated intermittent MDMA binges (3x5 mg/(kg day) given 3h apart, every 7th day for 4 weeks) were given to adolescent mice and rats. Behavioral responses in the open-field and autoradiographic ligand-binding to dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (SERT) transporters in reward regions of the brain were measured. In the open-field, total horizontal activity (HA) was significantly increased in both mice and rats following the first and third weekly administered MDMA binge. However, rats, but not mice, exhibited an enhanced activity in the centre of the open-field arena, indicating on reduced anxiety or enhanced impulsivity, which is known to be associated with altered serotonin activity. Specific binding of DAT, but not SERT, was significantly reduced in the mouse AcbSh and CPU using in vitro autoradiography. On the contrary, SERT, but not DAT density was significantly reduced in the AcbSh of rats. Taken together, our data provide evidence for differential regulation of DAT and SERT densities in reward-related brain regions of rats and mice after long-term intermittent administration of MDMA. ', '3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Alters Synaptic Dopamine Release in the Dorsal Striatum Through Nicotinic Receptors and DAT Inhibition. An increase of extracellular dopamine (DA) has been implicated in the psychostimulant properties of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Although this drug has been reported to affect the DA uptake transporter (DAT), it might activate other mechanisms to regulate the outflow of DA in the brain. Our aim was to examine the overall effects of MDMA on the release of DA in the striatum. We studied the effect of MDMA on stimulus-evoked synaptic DA release in dorsal striatal slices of mice using in vitro amperometric techniques. We also tested the effects of MDMA on the nicotine-induced responses in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) neurons using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. MDMA (1-30 uM) depressed the amplitude and prolonged the decay-time of synaptic DA release in the striatum. Interestingly, in the presence of the broad nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, and the more selective alpha4beta2 antagonist dihydrobetaerythroidine (DHbetaE), MDMA enhanced both peak and duration of DA release. A similar effect was found on cocaine-insensitive (DAT-CI) mice slices. Concentrations of MDMA higher than 100 uM enhanced striatal DA outflow that was in turn, reduced by cocaine. Electrophysiological recordings of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc showed that MDMA depressed the effects of nicotine. Our data are consistent with a prevalent MDMA-induced inhibition of the synaptic release of DA in the dorsal striatum mediated by an interaction with nicotinic receptors. This drug also blocks DAT acting on a different site from cocaine and, at higher concentrations, has amphetamine-like releasing properties. ', 'Interactions between bupropion and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in healthy subjects. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; \"ecstasy\") is a popular recreational drug. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of dopamine in the psychotropic effects of MDMA using bupropion to inhibit the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters through which MDMA releases dopamine and norepinephrine by investigating. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between bupropion and MDMA in 16 healthy subjects were investigated using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Bupropion reduced the MDMA-induced elevations in plasma norepinephrine concentrations and the heart rate response to MDMA. In contrast, bupropion increased plasma MDMA concentrations and prolonged its subjective effects. Conversely, MDMA increased plasma bupropion concentrations. These results indicate a role for the transporter-mediated release of norepinephrine in the cardiostimulant effects of MDMA but do not support a modulatory role for dopamine in the mood effects of MDMA. These results also indicate that the use of MDMA during therapy with bupropion may result in higher plasma concentrations of both MDMA and bupropion and enhanced mood effects but also result in lower cardiac stimulation. ', 'Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. ', 'Analysis of dopamine transporter gene expression pattern -- generation of DAT-iCre transgenic mice. The dopamine transporter is an essential component of the dopaminergic synapse. It is located in the presynaptic neurons and regulates extracellular dopamine levels. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the dopamine transporter gene, for investigations of gene function in dopaminergic neurons. The codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. The pattern of expression of the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene was similar to that of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene, as shown by immunohistochemistry. Recombinase activity was further studied in mice carrying both the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene and a construct expressing the beta-galactosidase gene after Cre-mediated recombination. In situ studies showed that beta-galactosidase (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl beta-D-galactoside staining) and the dopamine transporter (immunofluorescence) had identical distributions in the ventral midbrain. We used this animal model to study the distribution of dopamine transporter gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei in detail. The expression profile of tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis) was broader than that of beta-galactosidase in A12 to A15. Thus, only a fraction of neurons synthesizing dopamine expressed the dopamine transporter gene. The bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgenic line is a unique tool for targeting Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination to dopamine neurons for studies of gene function or for labeling living cells, following the crossing of these mice with transgenic Cre reporter lines producing fluorescent proteins. ', \"Association study of the SLC6A3 VNTR (DAT) and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A polymorphisms with alcohol dependence in a population from northeastern Brazil. Alcohol dependence (AD) is a complex psychiatric disorder, affecting 5.4% of the general population lifetime, characterized by excessive alcohol consumption influenced by environmental risk factors and genetic factors. Genetic alterations in dopaminergic system are involved in the treatment and etiology of AD. The aim of this search was to test the association of the SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a transporter and receptor of the dopaminergic system, with AD through a study in a population of northeastern Brazil. The study design was a case-control that included 227 males of northeastern Brazil (113 alcoholics and 114 controls). Alcoholics were classified according to the DSM-IV criteria for AD and controls were subjects who had nonalcohol problems or who never drank. Genotyping was detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR and RFLP-PCR for DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A, and subsequent electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies and association of polymorphisms with AD were assessed by chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and odds ratio (OR) with a confidence interval of 95% and significance p < 0.05. Data were analyzed on BioEstat 5.3 software. The SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR was associated with AD, allelic, and genotypic frequencies were significantly different, respectively (A9 vs. A10: OR = 1.88; p = 0.01; A9/A9 vs. A10/A10: OR = 6.25; p = 0.02; A9/A9 vs. A9/A10 + A10A10: OR = 5.44; p = 0.03). However, there was no statistically significant difference when the allelic (p = 0.10) and genotypic (p > 0.05) frequencies for DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A were compared. These findings suggest that A9 allele and A9/A9 genotype of the SLC6A3 40 bp-VNTR are involved in the vulnerability to AD in the population studied. However, for the DRD2/ANKK1 SNP does not present contributions to the development of AD. \"]\n",

      "Social anxiety and disordered overeating: an association among overweight and obese individuals. The study objectives were to evaluate the relationship between social anxiety, binge eating, and emotional eating in overweight and obese individuals and to evaluate the relationship between weight and social anxiety. Using an internet based survey, overweight and obese men and women (n=231; mean age=36.0+/-12.8; mean BMI=33.7 kg/m(2)+/-6.7) completed several self-report measures including: social anxiety, social physique anxiety, binge eating, and emotional eating. The relationships among variables were evaluated using Spearman's correlations, ANOVAs, and linear and logistic regression equations. Clinically significant levels of social anxiety were reported in 59% of participants, and binge eating disorder criteria were met by 13%. Social anxiety was significantly associated with binge eating (r=.36; OR=1.06, CI=1.02-1.10) and emotional eating (r=.46; beta=0.36), but was not associated with restrained eating. The association between social physique anxiety and emotional and binge eating did not remain significant in regression equations. BMI was associated with binge eating (r=.19) but not emotional eating. Level of social anxiety was not significantly higher among extremely obese participants, compared to overweight and obese participants. In this study, social anxiety was associated with binge eating and emotional eating in overweight and obese men and women. When appropriate, interventions could address social anxiety as a barrier to normative eating patterns and weight loss. \n",

      "Bupropion induces social anxiety in adolescent mice: Influence of housing conditions. The antidepressant bupropion has received increasing attention as a pharmacological tool to treat addiction although little is known about its effects on social behaviour in adolescents. The present study aimed to evaluate if environmental housing conditions influence bupropion's actions on social behaviour of adolescent mice. Mice were either group- or individually housed for 2-weeks and then randomly divided into 2 cohorts: half of the mice remained in the initial housing condition and the other half were changed to isolated conditions for further 2-weeks. The following groups were compared: isolated/isolated (ISO/ISO), isolated/group-housed (ISO/GR), group-housed/isolated (GR/ISO), and group-housed/group-housed (GR/GR). The effects of bupropion (40, 20, 10mg/kg) or saline on social interaction were assessed for each housing condition. Social encounters were evaluated using ethological analysis. Data showed significant effects of bupropion on grooming and digging. This drug diminished time mice allocated to these behavioural categories in all housing conditions. In ISO/GR and GR/ISO conditions, bupropion increased environmental exploration (non-social exploration and exploration from a distance), reduced social investigation and increased avoidance/flee and defence/submission behaviours. An augment of avoidance/flee during social interactions was observed in bupropion-treated mice in GR/GR housing condition. These results suggest that this drug exhibits anxiogenic-like properties in social encounters between adolescent mice, especially when a transition in housing conditions has been experienced during this period. Changes in housing conditions may be a useful model for evaluating the effects of bupropion on social behaviour and the role of environmental housing conditions. \n",

      "To describe an indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen based on the provided abstracts, we need to infer connections through the broader context of social anxiety, pharmacological interventions, and the known mechanisms of action of Baclofen and GABBR1.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GABBR1 and Baclofen**:\n",
      "   - **GABBR1**: This gene encodes the GABA_B receptor 1, which is part of the GABA_B receptor complex. GABA_B receptors are metabotropic receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.\n",
      "   - **Baclofen**: Baclofen is a GABA_B receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates GABA_B receptors, including those encoded by GABBR1. It is commonly used as a muscle relaxant and has been studied for its effects on anxiety and addiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Social Anxiety and Pharmacological Interventions**:\n",
      "   - The first abstract discusses the relationship between social anxiety and disordered eating behaviors in overweight and obese individuals. It suggests that social anxiety is significantly associated with binge eating and emotional eating.\n",
      "   - The second abstract examines the effects of bupropion, an antidepressant, on social behavior in adolescent mice. It finds that bupropion induces anxiogenic-like properties, particularly in social encounters, and that these effects are influenced by housing conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Indirect Relationship**:\n",
      "   - **Social Anxiety and GABA_B Receptors**: Social anxiety is a condition that can be modulated by the GABAergic system. GABA_B receptors, including those encoded by GABBR1, play a role in the inhibitory control of neurotransmission, which can affect anxiety levels.\n",
      "   - **Baclofen's Role**: Baclofen, as a GABA_B receptor agonist, can potentially reduce anxiety by enhancing GABAergic inhibition. This suggests that Baclofen might be used to alleviate social anxiety, which is indirectly related to the findings in the first abstract about social anxiety and disordered eating.\n",
      "   - **Bupropion and Anxiety**: The second abstract shows that bupropion can induce social anxiety-like behaviors in mice. While bupropion acts primarily on the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, its anxiogenic effects highlight the complexity of treating social anxiety pharmacologically.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the indirect relationship between GABBR1 and Baclofen can be described as follows: GABBR1 encodes a component of the GABA_B receptor, which Baclofen activates. Baclofen's activation of GABA_B receptors can modulate social anxiety, a condition that is also influenced by other pharmacological agents like bupropion. The studies on social anxiety and pharmacological interventions provide a context in which Baclofen, through its action on GABA_B receptors, could be relevant for addressing social anxiety and related behaviors.\n",

      "Dopaminergic polymorphisms in Tourette syndrome: association with the DAT gene (SLC6A3). Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by involuntary motor and phonic tics. The pattern of inheritance and associated genetic abnormality has yet to be fully characterized. A dopaminergic abnormality in this disorder is supported by response to specific therapies, nuclear imaging, and postmortem studies. In this protocol, dopaminergic polymorphisms were examined for associations with TS and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms investigated included the dopamine transporter (DAT1 DdeI and DAT1 VNTR), dopamine receptor (D4 Upstream Repeat and D4 VNTR), dopamine converting enzyme (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), and the acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) gene. DNA was obtained from 266 TS individuals +/- ADHD and 236 controls that were ethnicity-matched. A significant association, using a genotype-based association analysis, was identified for the TS-total and TS-only versus control groups for the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism (AG vs. AA, P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively). Population structure, estimated by the genotyping of 27 informative SNP markers, identified 3 subgroups. A statistical re-evaluation of the DAT1 DdeI polymorphism following population stratification confirmed the association for the TS-total and TS-only groups, but the degree of significance was reduced (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively). This study has identified a significant association between the presence of TS and a DAT polymorphism. Since abnormalities of the dopamine transporter have been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of TS, it is possible that this could be a functional allele associated with clinical expression. \n",

      "Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-kappaB, and beta-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors. \n",

      "Analysis of dopamine transporter gene expression pattern -- generation of DAT-iCre transgenic mice. The dopamine transporter is an essential component of the dopaminergic synapse. It is located in the presynaptic neurons and regulates extracellular dopamine levels. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the dopamine transporter gene, for investigations of gene function in dopaminergic neurons. The codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) gene was inserted into the dopamine transporter gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. The pattern of expression of the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene was similar to that of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene, as shown by immunohistochemistry. Recombinase activity was further studied in mice carrying both the bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgene and a construct expressing the beta-galactosidase gene after Cre-mediated recombination. In situ studies showed that beta-galactosidase (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl beta-D-galactoside staining) and the dopamine transporter (immunofluorescence) had identical distributions in the ventral midbrain. We used this animal model to study the distribution of dopamine transporter gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei in detail. The expression profile of tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis) was broader than that of beta-galactosidase in A12 to A15. Thus, only a fraction of neurons synthesizing dopamine expressed the dopamine transporter gene. The bacterial artificial chromosome-dopamine transporter-iCre transgenic line is a unique tool for targeting Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination to dopamine neurons for studies of gene function or for labeling living cells, following the crossing of these mice with transgenic Cre reporter lines producing fluorescent proteins. \n",

      "Recognition of benztropine by the dopamine transporter (DAT) differs from that of the classical dopamine uptake inhibitors cocaine, methylphenidate, and mazindol as a function of a DAT transmembrane 1 aspartic acid residue. Binding of cocaine to the dopamine transporter (DAT) protein blocks synaptic dopamine clearance, triggering the psychoactive effects associated with the drug; the discrete drug-protein interactions, however, remain poorly understood. A longstanding postulate holds that cocaine inhibits DAT-mediated dopamine transport via competition with dopamine for formation of an ionic bond with the DAT transmembrane aspartic acid residue D79. In the present study, DAT mutations of this residue were generated and assayed for translocation of radiolabeled dopamine and binding of radiolabeled DAT inhibitors under identical conditions. When feasible, dopamine uptake inhibition potency and apparent binding affinity K(i) values were determined for structurally diverse DAT inhibitors. The glutamic acid substitution mutant (D79E) displayed values indistinguishable from wild-type DAT in both assays for the charge-neutral cocaine analog 8-oxa-norcocaine, a finding not supportive of the D79 \"salt bridge\" ligand-docking model. In addressing whether the D79 side chain contributes to the DAT binding sites of other portions of the cocaine pharmacophore, only inhibitors with modifications of the tropane ring C-3 substituent, i.e., benztropine and its analogs, displayed a substantially altered dopamine uptake inhibition potency as a function of the D79E mutation. A single conservative amino acid substitution thus differentiated structural requirements for benztropine function relative to those for all other classical DAT inhibitors. Distinguishing the precise mechanism of action of this DAT inhibitor with relatively low abuse liability from that of cocaine may be attainable using DAT mutagenesis and other structure-function studies, opening the door to rational design of therapeutic agents for cocaine abuse. \n",

      "Involvement of nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway in the antidepressant action of bupropion, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the alterations in various behavioral and neurochemical basis of antidepressant action of bupropion [(+/-)-alpha-t-butylamino-3-chloropropiophenone], a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and to elucidate the possible mechanism of its action. The involvement of L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway in the antidepressant action of bupropion was investigated besides its actions on various brain transmitters like norepinephrine, dopamine and homovanillic acid. Bupropion (10, 15, 20 and 40 mg/kg., i.p.) dose dependently inhibited the immobility period in mice in both forced swim test and tail suspension test. ED(50) values of bupropion in reducing the immobility period was found to be 18.5 and 18 mg/kg i.p., in forced swim test and tail suspension test, respectively. Bupropion (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg., i.p.) reversed the reserpine-induced behavioral despair also. When different doses (10, 15, 20 and 40 mg/kg., i.p.) of bupropion were tested for locomotor activity, it (15, 20 and 40 mg/kg., i.p.) increased locomotor activity. At 20 and 40 mg/kg doses the drug showed hypothermia. The neurochemical analysis of brain samples revealed that bupropion dose dependently (10-40 mg/kg., i.p.) increased the brain contents of dopamine and homovanillic acid in the mouse whole brain. The levels of norepinephrine were also increased at 20 mg/kg dose. The antidepressant-like effect of bupropion (20 mg/kg., i.p.) was prevented by pretreatment with L-arginine (750 mg/kg., i.p.) [substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS)]. Pretreatment of mice with 7-nitroindazole (25 mg/kg., i.p.) [a specific neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor] produced potentiation of the action of subeffective dose of bupropion (10 mg/kg i.p.). In addition, treatment of mice with methylene blue (10 mg/kg., i.p.) [direct inhibitor of both nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)] potentiated the effect of bupropion (10 mg/kg., i.p.) in the forced swim test. Furthermore, the reduction in the immobility period elicited by bupropion (20 mg/kg., i.p.) was also inhibited by pretreatment with sildenafil (5 mg/kg., i.p.) [phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor]. The study indicated that bupropion possesses antidepressant activities in different animal models of depression through its dopaminergic and/or by modulating the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway. \n",

      "A Review of the Neuropharmacology of Bupropion, a Dual Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor. BACKGROUND: The neurochemical and biological effects of antidepressant medications have become better defined over the last decade. When the anti-depressant bupropion was introduced in the United States in 1989, the specific pharmacologic basis of its clinical effects was uncertain. Research conducted over the past decade has significantly advanced the understanding of the neuropharmacology of bupropion and has demonstrated a novel mechanism of antidepressant activity. This article discusses the mechanism of action of bupropion and relates the drug's neuropharmacologic effects to its clinical efficacy and tolerability profiles. DATA SOURCES: Data were obtained via the MEDLINE database in an English-language search spanning the period 1965 to May 2002 and using the search terms bupropion, bupropion SR, and antidepressants, as well as from the manufacturer's bupropion databases. CONCLUSIONS: The preclinical and clinical data show that bupropion acts via dual inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake and is devoid of clinically significant serotonergic effects or direct effects on postsynaptic receptors. Dual norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition is associated with a unique clinical profile. Bupropion has demonstrated efficacy comparable to that of other antidepressants. However, because bupropion is a selective norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor with no serotonergic activity, common antidepressant-associated side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and sedation, are not associated with bupropion therapy. \n",

      "Bupropion, methylphenidate, and 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone antagonize methamphetamine-induced efflux of dopamine according to their potencies as dopamine uptake inhibitors: implications for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence. Methamphetamine-abuse is a worldwide health problem for which no effective therapy is available. Inhibition of methamphetamine-induced transporter-mediated dopamine (DA) release could be a useful approach to treat methamphetamine-addiction. We assessed the potencies of bupropion, methylphenidate, and 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) to block DA uptake or to inhibit methamphetamine-induced DA release in HEK-293 cells expressing the human DA transporter. Bupropion, methylphenidate, and MDPV inhibited methamphetamine-induced DA release with relative potencies corresponding to their potencies to block DA uptake (potency ranks: MDPV > methylphenidate > bupropion). Bupropion and methylphenidate antagonize the effects of methamphetamine in vitro and may be potential candidates for the treatment of stimulant addiction. However, drugs that very potently antagonize the effect of methamphetamine are likely to also exhibit considerable abuse liability (MDPV > methylphenidate > bupropion). \n",

      "Effect of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors clorgyline and pargyline on the hyperphagia of obese mice. Obese-hyperglycemic mice (genotype ob/ob) have higher levels of hypothalamic norepinephrine than their normal-weight litter mates. Brain, as well as some other tissues, contains two types of monoamine oxidase (MAO). In this study we evaluated the effect of administering the Type A MAO inhibitor clorgyline (clorg) and the Type B MAO inhibitor pargyline (parg) on food intake. Acute administration of clorg/parg caused a temporary 50-90% decrease in food intake in normal mice, rats, golden, and Chinese hamsters, but did not alter the food intake of obese mice. To determine if alterations in the concentration of brain monoamines played a role in the effect of clorg/parg on food intake in mice, we determined the concentration of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in their cerebral cortex and hypothalamus after clorg/parg administration. When compared to normal mice, obese mice had a greater concentration of serotonin in their cerebral cortex and norepinephrine in their hypothalamus. As the obese mice had an equal or even greater increase in hypothalamic serotonin and norepinephrine concentration after clorg/parg administration than the normal mice, it is not likely that increased hypothalamic monoamines are responsible for the decreased food intake produced by clorg/parg administration. Obese and normal mice were treated with weekly injections of clorg/parg from 7 to 19 weeks of age. Clorg/parg produced a persistent 12% decrease in food intake and weight in obese, but not normal mice. Although the medication was discontinued at 19 weeks of age, the decrease in food intake and weight of the obese mice persisted until the time of sacrifice at 31-35 weeks. The combination of clorg/parg had a more profound effect on in vivo and in vitro MAO activity than equivalent amounts of the individual MAO inhibitors. Other anorectic agents such as D-amphetamine and fenfluramine had only a trivial in vitro effect on MAO activity. \n",

      "Evaluation of metabolism dependent inhibition of CYP2B6 mediated bupropion hydroxylation in human liver microsomes by monoamine oxidase inhibitors and prediction of potential as perpetrators of drug interaction. The objective of the study was to evaluate the metabolism dependent inhibition of CYP2B6 catalyzed bupropion hydroxylation in human liver microsomes by monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and to predict the drug-drug interaction potential of monoamine oxidase inhibitors as perpetrators of drug interaction. Human liver microsomal CYP2B6 activities were investigated using bupropion hydroxylation as probe substrate marker. The results from single point time dependent inhibition and shift assays suggest that clorgyline, pargyline, phenelzine, and selegiline were metabolism based inhibitors of CYP2B6. In IC50 shift assays, clorgyline, pargyline, phenelzine and selegiline are metabolism based inhibitors of CYP2B6 with fold shit of 3.0-, 3.7-, 2.9-, and 11.4-fold respectively. The inactivation of clorgyline was characterized by KI value of 2.5 +/- 0.3 and k(inact) value of 0.045 +/- 0.001 min(-1). Phenelzine inactivated CYP2B6 with KI and k(inact) values of 44.9 +/- 6.9 muM and 0.085 +/- 0.003 min(-1) respectively. Inactivation of selegiline was characterized with KI and k(inact) values of 22.0 +/- 3.3 and 0.074 +/- 0.002 min(-1) respectively. The inactivation caused by these inhibitors was not reversed by dialysis indicating irreversible inhibition. Based on the mechanistic static model, selegiline showed an increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of efavirenz and bupropion by 1.01-fold. Phenelzine predicted to cause an increase in the AUC of efavirenz and bupropion by 9.4- and 2.4-fold respectively considering unbound hepatic inlet concentrations of phenelzine. In conclusion, the results from this study demonstrated that MAO inhibitors can inactivate human liver microsomal CYP2B6. The likelihood of drug interaction when selegiline co-administered with CYP2B6 substrates is remote. Caution is required while co-administering phenelzine with substrates that are exclusively metabolized by CYP2B6 enzyme and substrates that have narrow therapeutic index. \n",

We determined allele frequencies for polymorphisms at several loci of interest in neuropsychiatry-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), dopamine transporter protein (SLC6A3), D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3), apolipoprotein E (APOE), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1)-in samples of individuals from populations in several different parts of the world. Associations with psychiatric illness have been proposed for specific polymorphisms at TPH (suicide-related behaviors and impulsivity), DRD3 (schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder), SLC6A3 (susceptibility to cocaine-induced paranoia and attention-deficit disorder), CNTF (psychosis), and OPRM1 (substance dependence). APOE alleles are related to risk of Alzheimer disease. We found significant allele frequency variation among populations at all six loci. These results will provide a global framework of normal variation at these loci that might have functional significance or otherwise be related to susceptibility to various disorders or behavioral phenomena. Knowledge of this variation can be important for study design and data interpretation when individuals from various population groups are research subjects and may eventually help lead to a better understanding of behavioral adaptation. \n",

      "Naltrexone modification of drinking effects in a subacute treatment and bar-lab paradigm: influence of OPRM1 and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) genes. Naltrexone is moderately effective for the treatment of alcohol dependence, but there is great individual variability. The opioid receptor (OPRM1) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) asn40asp has been shown to alter alcohol and naltrexone response in animals and humans. In addition, the brain opioid and dopamine systems interact and might underlie drinking and craving. This study investigated the effects of the OPRM1 SNP and dopamine transporter (DAT) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genetic differences on drinking, alcohol effects, and naltrexone response under controlled conditions in nontreatment-seeking alcoholics. Two hundred and sixty-five nontreatment-seeking individuals with alcohol dependence were genotyped a priori for the OPRM1 asn40asp SNP and post hoc for DAT (SLC6A3) 9 and 10 VNTRs. Asp40 carriers (n = 43) and matched asn40 homozygotes (n = 40) were randomized to naltrexone or placebo for 7 days before receiving a priming drink and limited-access alcohol consumption in a bar-lab setting. Effects of genotypes on natural drinking as well as drinking, alcohol effects, and response to naltrexone in the bar-lab setting were examined by genotype. There were no significant main effects of naltrexone or OPRM1 genotype, or any medication by OPRM1 interaction, on drinking variables. However, in individuals who had at least one DAT 9 VNTR, and who were also OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes, naltrexone reduced drinks/d consumed under natural conditions (p = 0.006), but not in the bar-lab. OPRM1 asn40 homozygotes (p = 0.028) and DAT 9 VNTR carriers (p = 0.032) had more stimulation to alcohol after the priming drink. This study does not support a salient role for the OPRM1 asp40 alone in predicting drinking or naltrexone effects. However, although exploratory and in need of replication, it introduces the possibility that epistasis between the OPRM1 gene and DAT gene might need to be taken into account when examining differential genetic response to alcohol or medication treatment, especially in early-stage alcoholics. \n",

      "OPRM1 and CYP2B6 gene variants as risk factors in methadone-related deaths. Methadone is a medication valued for its effectiveness in the treatment of heroin addiction; however, many fatal poisonings associated with its use have been reported over the years. We have examined the association between CYP2B6 and micro-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene variations and apparent susceptibility to methadone poisoning. Genomic DNA was extracted from postmortem whole blood of 40 individuals whose deaths were attributed to methadone poisoning. The presence of CYP2B6*4,*9, and *6 alleles and the OPRM1 A118G variant was determined by SNP genotyping. CYP2B6 *4, *9, and *6 alleles were found to be associated with higher postmortem methadone concentrations in blood (P < or = 0.05). OPRM1 A118G was also associated with higher postmortem methadone concentrations in blood but not to a level of statistical significance (P = 0.39). In these methadone-related deaths, OPRM1 118GA was associated with higher postmortem benzodiazepine concentrations (P = 0.04), a finding not associated with morphine-related deaths. The risk of a methadone-related fatality during treatment may be evaluated in part by screening for CYP2B6*6 and A118G. \n",

      "Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Bupropion and Its Metabolites in a CYP2B6 Drug-Drug-Gene Interaction Network. The noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion is metabolized by CYP2B6 and recommended by the FDA as the only sensitive substrate for clinical CYP2B6 drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. The aim of this study was to build a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of bupropion including its DDI-relevant metabolites, and to qualify the model using clinical drug-gene interaction (DGI) and DDI data. The model was built in PK-Sim(r) applying clinical data of 67 studies. It incorporates CYP2B6-mediated hydroxylation of bupropion, metabolism via CYP2C19 and 11beta-HSD, as well as binding to pharmacological targets. The impact of CYP2B6 polymorphisms is described for normal, poor, intermediate, and rapid metabolizers, with various allele combinations of the genetic variants CYP2B6*1, *4, *5 and *6. DDI model performance was evaluated by prediction of clinical studies with rifampicin (CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 inducer), fluvoxamine (CYP2C19 inhibitor) and voriconazole (CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 inhibitor). Model performance quantification showed 20/20 DGI ratios of hydroxybupropion to bupropion AUC ratios (DGI AUCHBup/Bup ratios), 12/13 DDI AUCHBup/Bup ratios, and 7/7 DDGI AUCHBup/Bup ratios within 2-fold of observed values. The developed model is freely available in the Open Systems Pharmacology model repository. \n",
